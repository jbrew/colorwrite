Move aside,
and let the man go through.
Let the man go through. If I stole
Somebody else's wave
To fly up. If I rose
Up with the avenue
Behind me. Some kind of verb.
Some kind of moving thing.
Something unseen.
Some hand is motioning
to rise, to rise, to rise. Too fat, fat you must cut lean.
You got to take the elevator to the mezzanine,
Chump, change, and it's on, super bon bon
Super bon bon, Super bon bon. And by
The phone
I live
In fear
Sheer Chance
Will draw
You in
To here. When you were languishing in rooms I built to foul you in
And when the wind set down in funnel form and pulled you in I don't need to walk around in circles
When the ghostly dust of violence traces everything
And when the gas runs out just wreck it, you insured the thing But I can't sigh now that you made the move
It has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor
For the right price I can get everything
Slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star I'm rolling...
I've gotta get a new balm
I've gotta get a tight tension on
I've got to slip it up before the rush gets gone I've got to feel it with the hot mind on
I'm rolling
Hey Norman was it thrown with a broken arm?
Bottle it up, to keep it warm I'm rolling
I know you got it but you got to go
I'm gonna get into the batter so the mix might glow
I hate to do it, but I did it though I'm gonna bite into the body like the risk is no risk
I got the souped up car and what you call tripping on the boom bap etymological
I ride the fader and I ride it low I'm gonna slip into the field like Han Solo
I'm rolling
One two into the amplifier, the electrified two Into the amplifier, and you got to get to
Into the amplifier, one two into the amplifier
I'm rolling The body like soft serve, dripping down in the June sun,
I tried to shoot a thought, but the thought sunk.
Nothing to do but scratch words in the dirt and
Watch the water roll down. Phantom kisses buzzing like the insects.
Beads of sweat dripping down on the rent check.
My Candyland melted down to syrup while I
Watched the water roll down. And here comes the lust in phaze,
but you're down in Marietta.
So sweet my mouth was seared,
But the words you mouthed were sweeter. My Sister,
Your words can be held against you in a court of law. My Sister, You owe no allegiance to the facts. And you're talking like the saint on the site of the accident.
Talking like the clause in the lease about the late rent.
Ringing like the random call patched to the payphone.
Talking like the water rolls down. Talking like the saint on the site of the accident.
Talking like the botched shot, attempt on the President.
Ringing like the change in the legless man's Dixie Cup.
Talking like the water rolls down. Day Undone,
Day Undone,
Day Undone,
Watch the water roll down. Move aside,
and let the man go through.
Let the man go through. If I stole

Wisted like knots on
The fingers
Jewels cleaving
Skin between
Breasts. Your Cadillac breathes
Four hundred horses
Over blue lines
You are going
To Reseda
To make love
To a model
From Ohio
Whose real name
You don't
Know You spin
Like the cadillac was
Overturning down a
Cliff on television
And the radio is on
And the radioman is speaking
And the radioman says
Women were a curse
So men built Paramount
Studios
And men built Columbia
Studios
And men built
Los Angeles It is 5 am
And you are listening
To Los Angeles And the radioman says
It is a beautiful night out there!
And the radioman says
Rock and Roll lives!
And the radioman says
It is a beautiful night out there
In Los Angeles
You live
In Los Angeles
And you are going to
Reseda; we are all
In some way or
Another going to
Reseda someday
To die
And the radioman
Laughs because
The radioman fucks
A model too Gone savage
For teenagers with
Automatic weapons and
Boundless love
Gone savage for
Teenagers who are
Aesthetically pleasing
In other words
Fly
Los Angeles beckons
The teenagers
To come to her
On buses;
Los Angeles loves
Love It is 5 am
And you are listening
To Los Angeles I am going to
Los Angeles
To built a screenplay about
Lovers who
Murder each
Other
I am going to
Los Angeles
To see my own
Name on a
Screen, five feet
Long and luminous
As the radioman says
It is 5 am
And the sun has charred
The other side of
The world and come
Back to us
And painted the smoke
Over our heads
An imperial violet
It is 5 am
And you are listening
To Los Angeles. You are listening.
You are listening.
You are listening.
You are listening. Her knees thrust in one direction
Like a symbol of math, a symbol meaning Greater Than. I come recommended by four out of five,
I'm a factor in the whole plan. Four and five therefore nine,
Nine and nine therefore eighteen,
Eighteen and eighteen therefore thirty-six,
Four and five therefore nine. Sometimes I was
Drifting on a coffee buzz. Quantify my luck
I need a mercy fuck. You crowd me out.
You crowd me out. Mid-level manager
Says he heard about
Some mulatto girl
Shot him in the mouth, And left him a hotel Near the mid-south offices.
He worked in distribution,
Regional vice-president. Collapse, unload it, pop! pop!
I must accumulate, unload it,
Pop! Pop! I must accumulate. Well the soil is rich
Competition fat
Ripe and vulnerable
Oozing from the slats And too cash-heavy, bloated
Sitting there all puckered up.
Index of numbers is,
Scrolling upscreen, scrolling up. Smash it down to digits.
Gut it out and break it down.
Liquid assets are Seeping down, seeping down now.
Seeping down, seeping down now. Dumb bah did do dumb
I need time to scrounge the rent, need time to contemplate the accident
I got to drag my ass to now, how did I come to stop here?
And oh I knew the gas was gone but I had to rev the motor Pull back the hand you might get it cut off in the motor
Maybe I'll come down
She's on Laureate's turf, she's on Laureate's side
She's in a better state, she feels a better fire And oh I dreamed a great parade, shooting all the guns in Brooklyn
The man who had a spare held out two and then you and then you took one
Freeze or burn, all else is only icing I stopped the thought before its drip became insistent,
I rubbed it out and loved the spot where it were missing,
She's widely known the only maquereau that pays her taxes,
I got to box her for the money, said it might end up
Reeling and stumbling,
I've got to bump around awhile. You don't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening.
You didn't use words like that.
St. Louise is listening. You rang the Eskimo to meet you at the station.
Oh, he's like milk to you, half Swedish and half Asian.
And your aphasia strikes out a bargain with the barter yard.
I got to box you for the money, said it might end up
Reeling and stumbling, I've got to bump around awhile. You don't use words like that.

By the hand of the Astronaut,
Builder of the pyramids,
The man from outer space.
Innocent farmgirl,
Raised by the aliens,
Out in Northridge,
Out in the larger world. Look away and she's eastbound, out of sight. Everything is going up.
Everything is going as planned, yeah.
Everything moves along.
Everything is fine, fine, fine. Oh I could be
Condemned to Hell for every sin but littering.
I could
Slip on the East River and crash into Queens all skittering.
I've seen the
Cops and the robbers, and I know they dance the same.
I've seen a
Half a zillion girls and haven't spoken to a single one of them. Batting in the light,
My reptile-lidded eyes.
And all this strung end to end,
Is wider than the mind. And this cool I've been playing I have been
Playing too long now my

So much smoke is wasted.
Sudden disappearance
In the air is thick and cool.
I can't approach myself
Skidding over this perdition
And now I'm out on the veranda
When I should have gone to school. Well I call for sleep,
But sleep it won't come to me.
Shuffling in the hallway,
I can hear him on the stairs.
I hear his lighter flicking.
I hear the soft sigh of his inhale.
And the whole width of my intentions
He exhales into the air. I got the will to drive myself sleepless. Skeedunt, stunt the runt,
Smoking buddha blunt. I got the will to drive myself sleepless. New York, New York
I won't go back
Indelible reminder of the steel I lack
I gave you seven years
What did you give me back?
A jaw-grind, disposition to a panic attack On this side the incumbent

At random serpentine
Through phatic coils emerging
Some other thought it's thinking
This light sounds above the houses on the ground
This illumination visited upon the whole land Unmarked helicopters, hovering

The demon was an idea
The demon is awake
The scratch mark left across the surface of your mind
This hour now upon us
The hour has now arrived Unmarked helicopters, hovering
The lord is coming soon
Unmarked helicopters, hovering
They said it was a weather balloon I know truth
I know the whole shebang
I know the names of men they had to hang

I heard what she said at them
They've come to drag her through the double-M It goes black, black, black, black, blacker
It goes black, black, black, black, blacker

Paleolithic eon
Put the fake goatee on
And it booms as cool as
Sugar free jazz Schools he bombs, he bombs Stack wax lie like a placemat
Won't lap
Or help you at the automat
And it's clear and clean as
Sugar free jazz Schools he bombs, he bombs But I have not seen it now or ever
Women descending on escalators
Coupled with this but also the same thing
Dolled up and spat out
So many dominations

A gumdrop
Lemon lime
And the numbers

I know the tablet is your competition
And I need for you to reasonable
How much? She said for three hundred dollars, I'll do it Zoom zip and uh wake up, uh zoom zip My eye like a noisegate the number 8 frustrate and I roll to the floor fruit
To the fruit to the core of a spheroid embedded in my skull the round the

Vitamin B-12 the synapse the synapse it feeds itself on a nutrient
Contained in sunlight the blink the lid the fight to snap open Moving up to the double M 2000 I eat up a decade like a flan your turn of

The verb tense Recombination, then Viacom, Safeway Oh pride is not a sin,
And that's why I have gone on down to Wal-Mart
With my checkbook to get you some. Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
I knoe you must've realized by now
And by the lawnchairs there Next to the racks of guns
Your self esteem is waiting
Canned up in alluminum Daughter to the pop veneer
Shining like a new mint quarter
Shining like the Franklin Mint
Seedy like the lampshade quarter Rolling with the dopes you know
Rolling with the wrong gun on you

She rocks the mop style, she needs the rest The Goat chewed up,
Once a tin can.
The Goat shat out,

Like a square cut.
Like a funny car.
Like a monster truck. Call up bop and I'm bunting stomach,
Koko mop I chop chunking plummet,
Thud on top, I ate the crocodile. And ever since then, I got disseminated,
The Jupiter Moon, I got disseminated,
The Average Man, I got disseminated,
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Toots Hibbert,
At the wrong prom.
Serves a beat down,
On a tom tom. Like Genius.
Like Dervin.
Like Joseph. I met a girl on roller skates
She had a spare bag, she had lost some weight Where I used to work, she was a waitress
She proposed a trade, it was generous
She's gone to Houston, feel like I'm floating in a warm sea
And if she finds out when she comes back, I know that she wil leave me Oh I heard a sign, it was a dull crack
It was a clock hand, It was snapping back
Oh it wasn't her's, it was the dope's kiss
I'll take the blame upon my shoulder, I just love to feel like this Roller Boogie, motherfucker There is a bar they call The Bitter Sea.
And she sits and drinks a velvet crush--that's
cool Aid and gin--casing the clientele
Like a relentless cameraman. She is
Elsewhere. She says You keep a-knocking
But you can't come in, and I say
Little Sister, don't you do what your Big Sister does Spiral down down down down down down down Well desire looks just like you with an uzi nine
Gundown fifteen bystanders in a roadside driveby
Desire is the grassfire drinking gasoline
And she says Open up your mouth, man, let me come inside Spiral down down down down down down down She cracked
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
She snapped
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
She's gone,
Gone gone Ah, leaning up against the wall
I will lash out dancing like a madman when you're gone
I will spit the blue flame and hurl my glass against the wall
And I will hear your name coming out from a boom box
I will hear your name called out from passing cars Spiral down down down down down down down She cracked When you were languishing in rooms I built to file you in
And when the wind set down in funnel form and pulled you in I don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in Don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in And when the ghostly dust of violence traces everything
And when the gas runs out, just wreck it, you insured the thing I don't need to walk around in circles

What I'm doing, I'm doing
Doom da doom da doom
What I'm doing, I'm doing But I can't sigh, now that you made the move
It has gone and gone to dogs, lay down on the floor
For the right price I can get everything
Slip into the car, go driving to the farthest star I don't need to walk around in circles

Sends the impulse
Through the air
Down to home And you can stand
On the arms
Of the Williamsburg Bridge
Crying
Hey man, well this is Babylon
And you can fire out on a bus
To the outside world
Down to Louisiana
You can take her with you I've seen the
Rains of the real world
Come forward on the plain
I've seen the Kansas of your sweet little myth
You've never seen it, no,
I'm half sick on the drinks you mixed
Through your True dreams
Of Wichita Brooklyn like a sea in the asphalt stalks
Push out dead air from a parking garage
Where you stand with the keys and your cool hat of silence
Where you grip her love like a driver's liscense I've seen you
Fire up the gas in the engine valves
I've seen your hand turn saintly on the radio dial
I've seen the airwaves
Pull your eyes towards heaven
Outside Topeka in the phone lines
Her good teeth smile was winding down Engine sputters ghosts out of gasoline fumes
They say You had it, but you sold it
You didn't want it, no
I'm half drunk on static you transmit
Through your True dreams
Of Wichita Punch it
I got, uh, fed
I got, uh, too much things on bounce, uh, my head
I got to burn 'em up
I got to burn 'em up now
I got to go uptown, uptown
I got a thing
I got a little bit pushed
got to stand on the corner and bellow for mush
I got a bomb
I got a baby bomb bomb
got to stand on the corner and bellow for my friend Tom
I got a thing, I got to thing it
I got to thing--team
I got to run my side True dreams You get the ankles
And I get the wrists.
You get the ankles
And I get the wrists.
You get the ankles
And I get the wrists.
You come down to this. Nerves are up
And the eyes all screwy
Blood like a panful
Of boiling ratatouille Hang from the axles of a box car
Follow the dotted line
Like a steer to Chicago
To the hooks of the Chicago man I get all tripped up
My eyes turn to water
Rug burns from a shag rug
Struck dumb in the presence
Polyester burns from a jacket
Rub the skin thin
Break down in a diner
Then I pay the bill His eyes go funny, you can't place why.
All dolled up in bellhop drag
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
I was once misinformed about your intentions Were you right to burn the rock star? Were you right to drop the roster?
On dollar bill, one dollar bill
Nah nah nah Here comes Suzy Snowflake
Dressed in a snow white gown
Tap, tap, tapping at your window pane
To tell you she's in town If you wanna make a snow man
I'll help you make one, one, two, three
And if you wanna take a sleigh ride
Whoop the ride's on me Here comes Suzy snowflake
Look at her tumbling down
Bringing joy to every girl and boy
Suzy's come to town If you wanna take a snowman
I'll help you take one, one, two, three
And if you wanna make a sleigh ride
Whoop the ride's on me When all the limbs are numb and clean,
And you're in transit, dream to dream,
I'll drift there to meet you, lazybones. When all the world has lain and sank,
And money sleeps inside the banks,
I'll drift there to meet you, layzbones. Cameraman sways to remember how the eye dances,
Drunkenness is a hand-held
Scrambling down Delancey
I come stumbling;
Well I hear you had to take a shine
And firing at random, I hear the rays fell upon mine. Cool you, Miss Amaze, with a handful of water
Trucks encircling, bearing down, coming louder.
If I could stay here, under your idle caress
And not exit to the world and phoniness and people. (M. Doughty)
Paint!
Paint!
Collide a clause, unremitting can you cram?
I know you're dumb as paint. I don't mind the worry following me like a dinosaur
I don't fear I am descending into the molten core
So far, I have not found the science
But the numbers keep on circling me I'm gonna give you most of mine
I'm gonna give it if I don't slip you Shooed out like a housefly
This house was half my mind
I don't dispute the doubts you've outlined
But it's my right to waste your time
And these things
It stands to reason
These things won't kill me
Your feelings
The spattering
It bores me
Don't tell me
Burned in on the 8th of May
She was spectacular
I walk a half-moon by the bus stop
Sliding 'cross the street to her
Three stings
Sequentially
Three strings
Won't kill me
Your spieling
Gracelessly
Is my grief
Please tell me
Half-masted, bass-boosted, slingbacked, fully retractable
Throw out the la-la by the busload
Match the photo to the description

I hear the spit
I hear the sigh
the wavelength
undivided
to drain the fruit
and leave the rind
the shot runs
through her wiring
through her curve
through her spine
to feel an impulse
rising rising
a mess of reason

Talking to her mom
Just to wish her a Happy Mother's Day Rachel's on the couch
Suckin' on the bong
Just so she can call her Mom Rachel's on the phone
Talking to her mom

Slap the rotor to the beat yeah
Stitching to till the pin breaks
Gotcha down
Onto the flatline
Clap the matter
It's the drop
How?
Revvin' it up into the stomp box
Sunkified gasman
Tripping in his own dribble
Tripping in the white man's outlay
Capitalism now
Screaming on a fat tomato
With a scream girl
Lips are thicker then a cow
I knew the bug
His wire running down into the hole
Greedy girl you're gonna snatch my soul
Supple backed a pole town
One two one two
Drumming on a guess
And I can't stand it
When a dream comes
Guzzling up the whole brain stem
I can not give up
And just stick this
But in the same way
Thought is useless
But you just come
Knock knock knocking
On a straw door
I could lose you for a nickel
But you just don't hear me
You don't stop
I knew the bug
His wire running down into the hole
Greedy girl you're gonna snatch my soul
Move it to the left side
I knew the bug
His wire running down into the hole
Greedy girl you're gonna snatch my soul

to the fruit to the core of a spheroid embedded in my skull the round the
zero the symbol of null and void and well I toyed with the concept of
vitamin B-12 the synapse the synapse it feeds itself on a nutrient
contained in sunlight the blink the lid the fight to snap open Moving up to the double M 2000 I eat up a decade like a flan your turn of

remaining but uh ah melancholy nonsense and I crack nouns brotherfuck
the verb tense Recombination, then Viacom, Safeway Signal got lost to the satellite
Got lost in the ride up to the plunge down
Man sends the ray of the electric light
Sends the impulse through the air, down to home And you can stand on the arms of the Williamsburg Bridge
Crying, hey man, well, this is Babylon
And you can fire out on a bus, the outside world down to Louisiana
You can say, corral with you I've seen the rains of the real world slink forward on the plain
I've seen the Kansas of your sweet little myth, you've never seen it, no
I'm half sick on the drinks you mixed through your
True dreams of Wichita, true dreams of Wichita A Brooklyn like a sea in the asphalt stalks
Push out dead air from a parking garage
Where you stand with the keys and your cool hat of silence
Where you grip her love like a driver's license I've seen you fire up the gas in the engine valves
I've seen your hand turn saintly on the radio dial
I've seen the airwaves pull your eyes towards heaven
Outside Topeka in the phone lines, her good seed smile was winding down The engine sputter goes, out of gasoline fumes
They say you had it, but you sold it
You didn't want it, no, I'm half drunk on babble you transmit
Through your true dreams of Wichita, true dreams of Wichita Push it, I got, uhh, fed
I got, uhh, too much things on bounce, on my head
I got to burn 'em up, I got to burn 'em up now
I got to go uptown, uptown I got a thing, I got a little bit pushed
Got to stand on the corner and bellow for mush
I got a bomb, I got a baby, bomb, bomb
Got to stand on the corner and bellow for my friend Tom I got a think, I got to think it
I got to thing, team, I got to run my side
True dreams, true dreams, true dreams of Wichita If I read the news, today ol' boy about the lucky man who made the grave
And though the news was rather sad, well, lines are sad so laugh
Well, lines are sad so laugh, well, lines are sad so laugh The Elphany!

Hold closed the jaw. How many cans must I stack up
To wash you out of my mind,
Out of my consciousness?
How many times must I cash out
To bring you back the check, fat
Off of my slenderness? She says "Yeah,
But he's not in right now".
You pause.
You like her answer. You know that but you go on.
You know but that you go on. How many cans must I stack up
To wash you out of my mind,
Out of my consciousness?
How many times must I cash out
To bring you back the check, fat
Off of my slenderness, Slenderness, Slenderness, Fire. (Note: These are not the lyrics of the recorded version, but of an
ealier version the band once performed live.)

A murder of lawyers in overcoats.
A murder of lawyers in overcoats.
A murder of lawyers in overcoats, shoulders up, heads slung low,
looking like a swarm of M's swarming the crosswalk. Looking up at a
window on the forty-fourth floor. Blueeyed Jew Mystic from a rhythm
section, his hands cupped around the dignified hijiki of human speech.
Muslim baritones idle with their hands down.
And the gat that fattens your jacket pocket
Plugs slugs in vain
Through the body of the immaterial witness.
And that which is Ugly and feeds on The Law comes into the conference
room singing federal jargon. Their necks are covered in chocolatey
growths. Spat up an eyeful of steam in the lumber yard parking lot.
Written in her own shit with a ground down fork.
Written in her own shit with a ground down fork
Written in her own shit with a ground down fork.
Written in her own shit with a ground down fork. As for my single self I had as life not be as live
To be in awe of such a thing as I myself. As for my own concern I had as think to think
As keep on thinking not so hard as for the brain to burn. And at the salad bar a man he stares into the croutons
Hypnotized by powers of the Bac-O-Bits. And I expose myself to stimuli
Unfit for people outside the controls of an experiment. Something I can't comprehend
Something so complex and
Couched in its equation
So dense that light cannot escape from In the dark your brain glows
And it goes
Way um way, way um way um I know you're a supra genius Will you shoot the blue earth down?
In the space station
Polishing the ray gun
You say correllation is not causation (M. Doughty)
Rachel's on the phone
talking to her Mom
Just to wish her a happy Mother's Day
Rachel's on the couch
Suckin' on the bong
Just so she can call her Mom
Rachel's on the phone
talking to her Mom
"Hi, Mom, it's me, Rachel." Fourteen thousand times a second
The speaker moves
Magnetism pushes
The impulse through
But I can't keep that speed
I can't generate that frequency
What the sound pressure level means
Wants a randomized electrons
I can't read
And you're still not dancing
She came pushing sixteen
She came pushing sixteen horses
I saw her and thought of her and thought of her
And I thought I heard a doorbell tone
And I thought I saw, thought I saw and thought I saw
You watching from the lawn
She went over bridges like the river was a dream, dream
Over bridges like the river was a dream, dream
She came pushing sixteen
She came pushing sixteen horses

Behind the wall. There is a chair. Moon Sammy knows. The chair is there. But that's OK, that's OK, you can do that--if you're wound up, full of tension,
incoherent. Your mouth is buttered with lies; you ask why, but you could
call it enigmatic; all your thoughts about the chair are full of static.
Automatically your mind goes down the stairwell to the chair; your body
says Moon Sammy, can you come back? Strum it. Moon Sammy washes. In the sink. Below the sink. There is a drain. The drain
goes straight. Into the sea. The sink itself. Is porcelain. Obsess yourself with causality. The information you hear is a loophole,
technicality. Behind every object is a mathematic; an obscure substance
infused with a kinetic force, energy, an obscure conscience shoots a gun at
the feet the world dances. Babylon, mystery, mother of harlots, and all these abominations of the
earth, that sits on many waters, drunk with the blood of the martyrs of
Jesus. And I wondered with great admiration. Darling

L'etat see'est moi
I drink the drink
And I'm wall to wall
I absorb trust like a love rhombus
I feel I must elucidate
I ate the chump with guile
Quadrilateral I was
Now I warp like a smile Yellow no. 5
Yellow no. 5, 5, 5 Voulez-vous the bus? Three times dark, first in the mind.
Second on Java street, the dead car there.
The hood blown off with a BB gun.
Manuela said she saw the brakes fail.
Manuela said she saw the brakes fail.
An empty body but it still bled
Oil from the axle and it left a trail.
Ran down Java street and formed a pool.
Manuela saw the moon in there.
Manuela saw the moon in there. I hear a rumbling.
I hear transmission grind.
I bear witness.
I have the clutch now. Three times dark, third on the rooftops;
Man jumps between and grabs the rail.
Man pulls the door but the door is locked.
Man gouge the hinge and goes down the stairs.
Man gouge the hinge and goes down the stairs.
Dull bright morning and the tools are gone.
Detectives with flashlights in the elevator shaft.
Manuela tells detectives she saw him there.
Stuck in the hinge is a sliver of a fingernail.
Stuck in the hinge is a sliver of a fingernail. Stack of tools in the Oldsmobile.
From the Motor City to the City of Dis.
They trace his travel by his credit card.
No sleep, smokes, and he's nauseous.
No sleep, smokes, and he's nauseous.
Flicks an ash like a wild loose comma.
Ash hits the oil around the pump.
Travels to the pump and the pump explodes.
Witness said he saw the car jump.

Max caps and I could blow
My only

I'll pull the zippers down
I will yank the reigns
Long gone and lonesome
In the airport lounge
I must have more thoughts than this Daughter to the pop veneer
Shining like a new mint quarter
Shining like the Franklin Mint
Seedy like the lampshade quarter Rolling with the dopes you know
Rolling with the wrong gun on you
Going down to Baltimore
Going in an off-white Honda Oh I miss the girl, miss the girl, miss the girl
I want to give myself to the water
Speeding to the rupture line
Rat-a-tatting boom box moocher Darling with the boop shuh-nai
Rat-a-tatting lose your future Stop hitching the monster man
It was a bad plan,
But i had to get to town
Unbitten,
But the way i found it was a hand came down
And pow,
I got illuminated That's why i have got my mind in my own
Hand over the wave,
Hand over the water,
The realest of the real
It's like the burnout said - phenomenon To the ruder bar in a buddha plump van
It was a stamped can,
It was a clamor
Understanding,
And all you people jumping but we raised the bar
You're dumber than a box of rocks
Give up, star The inscrutable,
The irrefutable,
The illegible,
The indisputable

Written in her own shit with a ground down fork. Slipping through the wrong plug, slap the rotor
To the beat, yeah, stitching to till, the pin breaks
Gotcha down onto the flat line, clap the matter
It's the drop, how? Revvin' it up into the stomp box Sunkified assman tripping in his own dribble
Tripping in the white man's outlay
Capitalism now screaming on a fat tomato
With a scream, girl lips are thicker than a cow I knew the bug, his wire running down into the hole
Greedy girl, you're gonna snatch my soul

Greedy girl, you're gonna snatch my soul
I know the bug, his wire running down into the hole
Greedy girl, you're gonna snatch my soul Supple backed a pole town, one, two, one, two
Drumming on a guess and I can't stand it
When a dream comes guzzling up the whole brain stem
I can not give up and just stick there But in the same way, thought is useless
But you just come knock, knock, knocking on a straw door
But I could lose you for a nickel
But you just don't hear me, you don't stop I know the bug, his wire running down into the hole
