Prepare the Mainboard (motherboard). If you want to assemble the well-liked device, you should use Intel i3,i5,i7 Mainboard.

Mount the CPU in the socket of the Mainboard. You must choose the correct CPU for your motherboard, and install it according to its instructions. Be careful not to install the CPU in wrong. Not only would your computer not work, it could short-circuit and damage your motherboard.

Connect the CPU cooler to the Mainboard.

Attach the RAM(memory) modules in the corresponding slots. the motherboard should have rows of slots that have 2 or 3 sections that are different lengths. Make sure the pins on the RAM cards line up with the pins on the motherboard connector. Don't get the RAM slots mixed up with PCI slots. The PCI slots are usually wider.

Open the case and mount the power supply which is M-ATX type. Make sure to connect all the connections to the drives and the motherboard.

Attach the Mainboard back plate to the case and check the Mainboard mounting positions. The motherboard's instructions should tell the position of the motherboard.

Suitably position the Mainboard in the case.

Mount the Hard disk and connect it to the power supply and the motherboard. There should be separate connections for the power supply and the motherboard. In SATA Hard disk case, should remove the jumper.

Connect the SATA connectors to the drives and the USB connectors and the case switches to the motherboard. The case and motherboard's instructions should tell where to connect the cables. [[Image:Step9_790.JPG|300px|]

Connect the 20 or 24 pin ATX connector and the 4-pin power supply control connector to the motherboard.

Mount the DVD-ROM drive. After connecting the ATA cable to the device, hook it up to the power supply.

Finally, select a compatible operating system, and follow the instructions to install.

Lay a cloth on a table big enough to accommodate the case, monitor, keyboard and speakers. Make sure that a power supply wall outlet can be reached. Remove case from packing box, making sure not to scratch case or destroy packing that will be recycled in shipping. Keep all packing materials back in the packing box. Place case on table. Unscrew the screws at the back of case and remove left and right side panels. Remove the front panel usually by pulling under the bottom of the front panel. Remove top DVD drive bay cover from the front of the case.
Remove the instruction manual if any and screws packet from the case. Keep the manual in a folder or envelope. Do the same for all manuals, warranties, paperwork, DVDs, CDs that might come with each component. This folder and its contents should stay with the finished computer. Tip - for this folder you can use the motherboard plastic wrapper when you later unwrap the motherboard.
Keep the screws packet handy for use. When it comes to which screws to use where, because the different screw sizes look very much alike, use the size that fits best! Tip - generally the hard drive screws are a slightly bigger size. The PSU screws are also the same size but sometimes have a bigger head.The DVD screws are a bit smaller. Motherboard screws may be the same as the hard drive or DVD screws.
For the CurrentBuild Dream PC, a gaming PC, in preparation for installing a two slot video card remove from the case's rear the two metal brackets corresponding to the motherboard's PCI express x16 slot and the one next to it by unscrewing them and/or snapping them out. These are usually the two highest slots. If you are installing a single slot video card remove only one metal bracket corresponding to the PCI express x16 slot. Depending on the case you may have to remove a slot cover before removing the metal bracket(s).
If you plan on installing an internal adapter card, say for example a PCI Express wireless adapter card if you want your PC to have the ability to connect to a wireless network in addition to a wired network, remove the metal bracket from the case rear corresponding to the PCI Express x1 slot on your motherboard that is farthest from the PCI express x16 video card slot. You want to give a video card that you install now or add one in the future as much room as possible for air flow and cooling.

MAKE SURE VOLTAGE SWITCH ON PSU IS SET TO RIGHT VOLTAGE FOR YOUR COUNTRY! Stand the case. Position power supply unit in its designated section in the case with the power plug socket facing outside the case rear and it's fan side placed facing the inside of the case, you don't want the fan facing into a case ceiling, floor or side panel. Fasten 4 screws that came with the case through rear of case into PSU to hold PSU in place. Tighten all screws with fingertip force only to avoid over tightening and potential damage.

Remove from the front panel of the case the top external 5.25 inch drive bay cover for the DVD drive if not already done so when getting the computer case ready. Remove any steel grill from the entrance of this bay on the case so you can slide the DVD drive in. Usually there is no grill for this top bay.
Slide DVD drive into this bay from the front of the case, so it rests on the small ledges inside the bay. Slide in so it is level with the front panel, and so the screw holes on each side of the DVD drive line up with the holes on the drive bay of the case. Fasten with 8 screws, 4 on each side.

DO NOT SCRATCH MOTHERBOARD TO AVOID POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO ETCHINGS ON MOTHERBOARD
Lay case on its side with open side facing up, back of case (rear outputs side) closest to you. Drape all case wires including PSU wires outside case, making sure not to scratch case, to clear the motherboard area. Snap in the metal outputs shield that came with the motherboard into the case rear outputs section as follows. Snap it in from the inside of the case after aligning the three vertical round holes (audio output holes) on the shield to your right when facing the case. Install shield by snapping along edges till small points take hold.
Screw motherboard standoff screws (they look like studs with screws), that came with the case into the case. Mini-itx motherboards usually require 4 standoff screws, micro-atx motherboards require 6 or 8 standoff screws, atx motherboards require 9 standoff screws, check your motherboard to confirm. Screw the standoff screws into the 4, 6, 8 or 9 holes that will match the location of holes on your motherboard when placed on the standoff screws. You might want to hold the motherboard carefully over the case just to visually line up the motherboard holes and the case standoff screw locations.
Tighten the standoff screws into the case with fingertip force only using a 5mm nut driver tool or similar tool. Tip - the case manufacturer often provides a 5mm socket or nut driver tool along with the motherboard standoff screws for this job. Look carefully in the screws packet, this socket can be a very small item, and it's easy to confuse it for a thumb screw. If no tool is provided, because some of these standoff screw locations are close to a case edge, a 5mm socket with a screwdriver that turns the socket is your cheapest tool solution you might just have at home. You can angle the screwdriver a bit if the case edge is in the way.
Test which size screw that came with the case fits into the standoff screws before placing the motherboard on the standoff screws. It's hard to get out the wrong sized screw if the motherboard is in place. Place motherboard on top of the standoff screws while at the same time aligning the motherboard's output connectors with the corresponding holes in the metal output shield on the case. Fasten 6 or 8 of these screws through the motherboard into the standoff screws to fasten motherboard to the case. Make sure the screws do not fall on the motherboard and use a screwdriver that fits the screw well so it won't slip out on the motherboard while tightening. Again, tighten screws with fingertip force only to avoid damage. Also at some point in the future you may want another motherboard and you don't want a nightmare unscrewing overly tightened screws.Follow any installation instructions that came with cpu. They are usually as follows. Handle CPU with care touch only by the sides! Don't touch the socket on the motherboard! Note location of a triangle marked on one corner of the CPU plastic cap that covers the CPU socket on the motherboard. A triangle is also marked on the socket's metal bracket under the plastic cap which you can't see at this time. Leave the plastic cap in place for now. Unlock CPU socket lever on the motherboard and turn back the CPU socket plastic cap and metal bracket still together, exposing the CPU socket.
Align gold triangle on CPU with the corner of the CPU socket where the triangle was noted, and also align the two notches on the CPU sides with the CPU socket and place CPU in socket. Return CPU socket metal bracket over CPU making sure front of metal bracket slides under the retention knob on the motherboard, then lock CPU lever to lock CPU in place. This action will remove the CPU plastic cap by snapping it off. Keep it with the PC documentation you might need it in the future.
Follow any installation instructions that came with CPU heat sink and CPU fan. They are usually as follows. Make sure the thermal paste on the bottom of the CPU heat sink is not wiped off by placing on another surface. Unwind CPU fan wire from around the CPU fan or else it will hit the fan blades during fan operation. Place CPU heat sink and CPU fan unit on the CPU making sure the CPU fan wire is on the side with easy access to the CPU fan header (a slot or connector) on the motherboard. Connect the 4 CPU heat sink connectors to the motherboard per instructions from the CPU manual. Usually it's first align and then push in these connectors securely into the 4 holes on the motherboard around the CPU socket, locking it to the motherboard. There are arrows on the top of each of the 4 CPU heat sink connectors, they should point in the locked position, usually the default position when you first take the CPU heat sink out of its packing box. Check the CPU manual to confirm the direction of these arrows for the locked position.
Connect CPU fan to CPU fan header on motherboard. Align the fan's connector with the tab on the motherboard CPU fan header and insert. Tuck the fan wire away from the CPU fan and the PSU fan. Refer motherboard manual for motherboard diagram to find locations for all headers, jumpers and other connectors on the motherboard. If you don't have a motherboard manual download it from the motherboard manufacturer's website, or you can just look at the motherboard though markings are often coded and small to read.
Install one memory stick in memory slot 1. Desktop memory slots are now called DIMM slots. If you're installing a second memory stick install it in the memory slot that is the pair to memory slot 1. Memory slot pairs are identified by being the same color. This could be memory slot 2 or memory slot 3 on motherboards with 4 memory slots. On motherboards with 2 memory slots, just insert the second memory stick in memory slot 2.
To install a memory stick, unlock the corner clasps on the DIMM memory slot you will be using on the motherboard. Make sure the notch on the memory stick metal edge aligns with the notch in the memory slot before inserting it. Make sure you insert the memory stick all the way into the slot. This usually causes the corner clasps of the DIMM slot to click in and lock the memory stick in place. If this doesn't happen make sure the memory stick is all the way into the slot and then manually lock in the clasps.Check which empty slot in the 3.5 inch internal drive bay in the case would be best for the hard drive to be inserted based on the least interference to or blocking motherboard connections. Look at the motherboard in relation to these slots and decide. For the Sense PC this would be second from top slot, for the Dream PC this would be the top slot. Stand case, insert the hard drive into this selected bay making sure the label side of the drive faces up, and the hard drive connectors face into the case. Push in the hard drive so the screw holes on each side of the hard drive line up with the holes on the drive bay of the case, and the hard drive rests on the 4 small ledges inside the drive bay. Fasten 4 screws to these holes, 2 on each side, to secure the hard drive to the drive bay.
If you're installing a 2.5 inch solid state drive SSD as a replacement or in addition to a HDD check to see if your case has a 2.5 inch internal drive bay. It may be at the inside floor of the case, requiring four screws to attach the SSD to the inside floor of the case. These screws are the same size as the DVD drive screws. Before installing make sure the SSD connectors face toward the motherboard so you can connect SATA cables from the motherboard and PSU wires to the SSD.
If your case does not have a 2.5 inch internal drive bay for your SSD you will need to use an adapter bracket to install the 2.5 inch SSD drive into the 3.5 inch internal drive bay of the computer case. The adapter bracket is a separate part. It's very simple, just fasten the SSD drive to the bracket with 4 screws and then fasten the bracket to an open case drive bay as described above for a HDD, again making sure the SSD connectors face toward the motherboard and the top of the SSD faces the top of the case. Note also the bracket should be fastened to the case drive bay so the SSD is on top of or resting on the bracket base as opposed to being under or suspended from the bracket base.
If you're installing an M.2 SSD check the location of the hole or half hole at one end of the M.2 SSD and then make sure there is a screw and nut in the corresponding location on the motherboard when the M.2 SSD is inserted in the M.2 slot on the motherboard. If the screw and nut are not in the corresponding location remove the screw and nut from the motherboard and place just the nut in the corresponding location. If it is in the corresponding location just remove the screw. Insert the M.2 SSD at an angle into the M.2 slot on the motherboard, gently press the M.2 SSD down so it lies flat on the motherboard, and secure it to the motherboard with the screw and nut.
 Clear CMOS to reset BIOS or UEFI settings
Place case back on its side with motherboard facing up, bottom of case closest to you, and case wires and PSU wires draped outside case. To reset the BIOS or UEFI to its default settings, clear CMOS memory by using the CMOS header on the motherboard. Refer motherboard manual for these instructions. Usually this involves simply moving the jumper from pins 1 and 2 on the CMOS header to pins 2 and 3 for ten seconds and then returning the jumper back to pins 1 and 2 where they stay. If there is no pin 3 just touch the metal part of a screwdriver to pins 1 and 2 for ten seconds (don't scratch motherboard).
 Tuck and tie PSU wires
If your PSU has a modular wiring arrangement only install the wire modules you need as you go along with the assembly. If your PSU does not have modular wiring, start by separating the PSU wires you will not be using and tuck and tie these wires behind the motherboard, if the case has that feature, or around the motherboard into empty case areas keeping the drive bays clear as much as possible for future expansion. As you proceed with the steps below connecting the rest of the wires to connectors, do the same for those wires. This keeps the motherboard uncluttered for air flow so it stays cool, and for a neat and organized look. This is more an art than a science.
 Connect power to motherboard
Plug in 20 + 4 pin main power connector from the PSU to the main power header on motherboard. The pins shapes match the pin sockets and can only be inserted one way. The clasp on the connector will direct you. Make sure the clasp locks to the header.
 Connect power to CPU
Plug in the 4 pin CPU power connector from the PSU to the CPU power header on motherboard. Make sure to connect by matching pin shapes on connector to pin sockets on header. The clasp on the connector will direct you, and make sure the clasp locks to the header. If you use a more powerful PSU this CPU power connector will have 8 pins, no problem just connect 4 of the pins, again the shape of the pins and the clasp will direct you which 4 pins to use and the direction it plugs in. If your motherboard has an 8 pin socket CPU power header then connect all 8 pins from the PSU CPU power connector, again matching pin and socket shapes. Note some mini-itx motherboards with embedded CPUs don't have a CPU power header, check the motherboard manual to make sure.
 Connect case front panel wires to motherboard
Connect the following wires from the case to the front panel header (or system panel header) on the motherboard. The case's power button wire, reset button wire, power LED wire and HDD LED wire. If the case has a speaker, connect case's speaker wire to speaker header on motherboard.
From the diagram of the motherboard in the motherboard manual find the location of the front panel header and speaker header. This is where these case wires connect. Each case wire has a pair of connectors at the end, except for the speaker wire which has more, that are inserted over the corresponding pins on these motherboard headers.
Turn to the page in the motherboard manual where you find details on front panel header connections and accordingly connect the case wires. For example, for the case's power button wire the manual will point to two specific pins on the front panel header where this wire connects to. The manual will show one of these pins on the header as 'power button', the other pin will be shown as 'ground'. On the case's power button wire there is a tiny triangle, which is hard to see, marked at the end of one of its two connectors that is the 'power button' or positive connector, the other connector without the triangle is the 'ground' connector. Accordingly connect the power button connector to the power button pin on the header, and the ground connector to the ground pin. Tip - usually the case wires connectors with these triangles signifying a positive charge have a wire color other than white, while the ground wires are white. However different case manufacturers might follow different conventions so check for the triangle to confirm which connector is positive.
Once you understand where a case wire connects to the front panel header by knowing what to look for the rest is easy.
 Connect case front panel USB 3 wire to motherboard
Connect case's front panel USB 3 wire from case to a USB 3 header on motherboard. Align the notch on the connector with the notch on the header and insert connector. If your case has only a front panel USB 2 cable connect it to a USB 2 header on the motherboard.
 Connect case front panel HD audio wire to motherboard
Connect case's front panel HD audio wire from case to front panel audio header on motherboard. Align the connector accordingly with the missing pin on the header and insert.
 Connect case fan to motherboard
Connect case fan to case fan header (or chassis or 'cha_fan1' or 'sys_fan1' header) on motherboard. Your case fan may have a 3 pin or a 4 pin connector, while your case fan header is likely a 4 pin header. The 4th pin can control the fan speed. The other pins are ground, power and monitoring fan speed. Either way, whether 3 pin or 4 pin, make sure the connector aligns with the tab on the header, so you make the right connection.
 Connect power to HDD/SSD and DVD
Connect a power rail with SATA connectors from PSU to HDD and/or SSD. Note for an M.2 SSD no PSU connector is required.
Connect a separate power rail with SATA connectors from PSU to DVD.
Note that the inside of SATA PSU connectors have a 'L' shape, so align the connectors accordingly.
 Connect SATA cables from motherboard to HDD/SSD and DVD
Connect a SATA cable that came with the motherboard starting from the lowest numbered motherboard SATA 6 Gbps header to HDD and/or SSD. This could be SATA 0 or SATA 1 depending on the motherboard. Note for an M.2 SSD no SATA cable from the motherboard is required.
Connect another SATA cable that came with the motherboard from the next numbered motherboard SATA 6 Gbps header to DVD.
Note that the inside of SATA motherboard connectors have a 'L' shape, so align the connectors accordingly.
Note, if you are connecting two HDD/SSDs connect these drives to the lowest and next numbered SATA connectors and the DVD to the third. This is important where the motherboard has only two SATA 6 Gbps connectors and the rest are SATA 3 Gbps. You want the hard drives to have the faster connection, the DVD is fine with SATA 3 Gbps speed.
Adding this section for CurrentBuild Dream PC, a gaming computer and power PC, which uses a separate video card. Or use these these instructions if you ever want to add a video card to your Sense PC, thereby easily upgrading your PC to a gaming PC!
If not already done so remove from the case's rear the two metal brackets corresponding to the motherboard's PCI express x16 slot and the one next to it. These are usually the two highest slots. This is for a dual slot video card, for a single slot video card remove only one metal bracket corresponding to the motherboard's PCI express x16 slot. Depending on the case you may have to remove a slot cover before removing the metal bracket(s).
Remove any plastic covers on the video card's metal connectors and output connectors. Unlock the corner clasp on the PCI express x16 slot on the motherboard and insert the video card into the slot. Once inserted, manually relock the corner clasp to the video card, it may automatically do this when the video card is inserted, but check to see it's done. Screw the video card's two metal brackets to the case rear to fasten the card. Some cases have a slot cover that goes on over the brackets before you screw the brackets to the case, in which case use this cover as well. Make sure you don't scratch the motherboard with the video card's metal brackets or other part.
If the video card has a power connector slot, connect to this a 6 pin or 8 pin PCI Express power connector from the PSU, matching the slot holes on the video card. More powerful video cards can have two 6 pin or two 8 pin power connectors, in which case connect two connectors. Route this PSU PCI Express wire behind the motherboard if the case has motherboard plate cutouts for wires, otherwise route it around the motherboard behind the main power connector in order to reduce clutter and increase air flow.
 Install internal adapter card
Adding this in case you want to install an internal adapter card, for example a PCI Express wireless adapter if you want your PC to connect to a wireless network instead of a wired network.
If not already done so remove from the case rear the metal bracket corresponding to the motherboard's PCI Express x1 slot that is farthest from the PCI Express x16 video card slot. As stated earlier you want to give a video card that you install now or add one in the future as much room as possible for cooling. Insert the adapter card into the slot. Screw the adapter card's metal bracket to the case rear to fasten the adapter to the case. Some cases have a metal cover that goes on over the bracket before you screw the bracket to the case, in which case use this cover as well. Attach any antenna provided with a wireless adapter card to the adapter's inputs at the case rear. As usual make sure you don't scratch the motherboard with the adapter card's metal bracket or other part.
 Place CurrentBuild Sense PC logo label on case
Place CurrentBuild Sense label sticker at center and top of front panel.
 Test connections
Plug in PSU power cord into PSU and to wall outlet and start computer. Use usual precautions when handling electricity! Test to see the following are running - all 3 fans - case, CPU, PSU, (and video card fan(s) if separate video card installed). Test power button (PC comes on and off) and reset button (PC reboots). Test to see all 3 LED lights work - PLED light (power on light that stays on when PC is on), DVD LED light (comes on at start then goes off), HDD LED light (blinks initially).
 Put back case left, right and front panels
Screw back case left and right panels with thumb screws. Make sure you get the sides correctly, a case side panel with a window faces the front side of the motherboard giving the components ventilation.
See how to choose a computer case. Lay a cloth on a table big enough to accommodate the case, monitor, keyboard and speakers. Make sure that a power supply wall outlet can be reached. Remove case from packing box, making sure not to scratch case or destroy packing that will be recycled in shipping. Keep all packing materials back in the packing box. Place case on table. Unscrew the screws at the back of case and remove left and right side panels. Remove the front panel usually by pulling under the bottom of the front panel. Remove top DVD drive bay cover from the front of the case. Remove the instruction manual if any and screws packet from the case. Keep the manual in a folder or envelope. Do the same for all manuals, warranties, paperwork, DVDs, CDs that might come with each component. This folder and its contents should stay with the finished computer. Tip - for this folder you can use the motherboard plastic wrapper when you later unwrap the motherboard. Keep the screws packet handy for use. When it comes to which screws to use where, because the different screw sizes look very much alike, use the size that fits best! Tip - generally the hard drive screws are a slightly bigger size. The PSU screws are also the same size but sometimes have a bigger head.The DVD screws are a bit smaller. Motherboard screws may be the same as the hard drive or DVD screws. For the CurrentBuild Dream PC, a gaming PC, in preparation for installing a two slot video card remove from the case's rear the two metal brackets corresponding to the motherboard's PCI express x16 slot and the one next to it by unscrewing them and/or snapping them out.

It's very simple, just fasten the SSD drive to the bracket with 4 screws and then fasten the bracket to an open case drive bay as described above for a HDD, again making sure the SSD connectors face toward the motherboard and the top of the SSD faces the top of the case. Note also the bracket should be fastened to the case drive bay so the SSD is on top of or resting on the bracket base as opposed to being under or suspended from the bracket base. If you're installing an M.2 SSD check the location of the hole or half hole at one end of the M.2 SSD and then make sure there is a screw and nut in the corresponding location on the motherboard when the M.2 SSD is inserted in the M.2 slot on the motherboard. If the screw and nut are not in the corresponding location remove the screw and nut from the motherboard and place just the nut in the corresponding location. If it is in the corresponding location just remove the screw. Insert the M.2 SSD at an angle into the M.2 slot on the motherboard, gently press the M.2 SSD down so it lies flat on the motherboard, and secure it to the motherboard with the screw and nut. Clear CMOS to reset BIOS or UEFI settings Place case back on its side with motherboard facing up, bottom of case closest to you, and case wires and PSU wires draped outside case. To reset the BIOS or UEFI to its default settings, clear CMOS memory by using the CMOS header on the motherboard. Refer motherboard manual for these instructions. Usually this involves simply moving the jumper from pins 1 and 2 on the CMOS header to pins 2 and 3 for ten seconds and then returning the jumper back to pins 1 and 2 where they stay. If there is no pin 3 just touch the metal part of a screwdriver to pins 1 and 2 for ten seconds (don't scratch motherboard). Tuck and tie PSU wires If your PSU has a modular wiring arrangement only install the wire modules you need as you go along with the assembly. If your PSU does not have modular wiring, start by separating the PSU wires you will not be using and tuck and tie these wires behind the motherboard, if the case has that feature, or around the motherboard into empty case areas keeping the drive bays clear as much as possible for future expansion. As you proceed with the steps below connecting the rest of the wires to connectors, do the same for those wires. This keeps the motherboard uncluttered for air flow so it stays cool, and for a neat and organized look. This is more an art than a science. Connect power to motherboard Plug in 20 + 4 pin main power connector from the PSU to the main power header on motherboard. The pins shapes match the pin sockets and can only be inserted one way. The clasp on the connector will direct you. Make sure the clasp locks to the header. Connect power to CPU Plug in the 4 pin CPU power connector from the PSU to the CPU power header on motherboard. Make sure to connect by matching pin shapes on connector to pin sockets on header. The clasp on the connector will direct you, and make sure the clasp locks to the header. If you use a more powerful PSU this CPU power connector will have 8 pins, no problem just connect 4 of the pins, again the shape of the pins and the clasp will direct you which 4 pins to use and the direction it plugs in. If your motherboard has an 8 pin socket CPU power header then connect all 8 pins from the PSU CPU power connector, again matching pin and socket shapes. Note some mini-itx motherboards with embedded CPUs don't have a CPU power header, check the motherboard manual to make sure. Connect case front panel wires to motherboard Connect the following wires from the case to the front panel header (or system panel header) on the motherboard. The case's power button wire, reset button wire, power LED wire and HDD LED wire. If the case has a speaker, connect case's speaker wire to speaker header on motherboard. From the diagram of the motherboard in the motherboard manual find the location of the front panel header and speaker header. This is where these case wires connect. Each case wire has a pair of connectors at the end, except for the speaker wire which has more, that are inserted over the corresponding pins on these motherboard headers. Turn to the page in the motherboard manual where you find details on front panel header connections and accordingly connect the case wires. For example, for the case's power button wire the manual will point to two specific pins on the front panel header where this wire connects to. The manual will show one of these pins on the header as 'power button', the other pin will be shown as 'ground'. On the case's power button wire there is a tiny triangle, which is hard to see, marked at the end of one of its two connectors that is the 'power button' or positive connector, the other connector without the triangle is the 'ground' connector. Accordingly connect the power button connector to the power button pin on the header, and the ground connector to the ground pin. Tip - usually the case wires connectors with these triangles signifying a positive charge have a wire color other than white, while the ground wires are white. However different case manufacturers might follow different conventions so check for the triangle to confirm which connector is positive. Once you understand where a case wire connects to the front panel header by knowing what to look for the rest is easy. Connect case front panel USB 3 wire to motherboard Connect case's front panel USB 3 wire from case to a USB 3 header on motherboard. Align the notch on the connector with the notch on the header and insert connector. If your case has only a front panel USB 2 cable connect it to a USB 2 header on the motherboard. Connect case front panel HD audio wire to motherboard Connect case's front panel HD audio wire from case to front panel audio header on motherboard. Align the connector accordingly with the missing pin on the header and insert. Connect case fan to motherboard Connect case fan to case fan header (or chassis or 'cha_fan1' or 'sys_fan1' header) on motherboard. Your case fan may have a 3 pin or a 4 pin connector, while your case fan header is likely a 4 pin header. The 4th pin can control the fan speed. The other pins are ground, power and monitoring fan speed. Either way, whether 3 pin or 4 pin, make sure the connector aligns with the tab on the header, so you make the right connection. Connect power to HDD/SSD and DVD Connect a power rail with SATA connectors from PSU to HDD and/or SSD. Note for an M.2 SSD no PSU connector is required. Connect a separate power rail with SATA connectors from PSU to DVD. Note that the inside of SATA PSU connectors have a 'L' shape, so align the connectors accordingly. Connect SATA cables from motherboard to HDD/SSD and DVD Connect a SATA cable that came with the motherboard starting from the lowest numbered motherboard SATA 6 Gbps header to HDD and/or SSD. This could be SATA 0 or SATA 1 depending on the motherboard. Note for an M.2 SSD no SATA cable from the motherboard is required. Connect another SATA cable that came with the motherboard from the next numbered motherboard SATA 6 Gbps header to DVD. Note that the inside of SATA motherboard connectors have a 'L' shape, so align the connectors accordingly. Note, if you are connecting two HDD/SSDs connect these drives to the lowest and next numbered SATA connectors and the DVD to the third. This is important where the motherboard has only two SATA 6 Gbps connectors and the rest are SATA 3 Gbps. You want the hard drives to have the faster connection, the DVD is fine with SATA 3 Gbps speed. Install video card See how to choose a video card. Adding this section for CurrentBuild Dream PC, a gaming computer and power PC, which uses a separate video card. Or use these these instructions if you ever want to add a video card to your Sense PC, thereby easily upgrading your PC to a gaming PC! If not already done so remove from the case's rear the two metal brackets corresponding to the motherboard's PCI express x16 slot and the one next to it. These are usually the two highest slots. This is for a dual slot video card, for a single slot video card remove only one metal bracket corresponding to the motherboard's PCI express x16 slot. Depending on the case you may have to remove a slot cover before removing the metal bracket(s). Remove any plastic covers on the video card's metal connectors and output connectors. Unlock the corner clasp on the PCI express x16 slot on the motherboard and insert the video card into the slot. Once inserted, manually relock the corner clasp to the video card, it may automatically do this when the video card is inserted, but check to see it's done. Screw the video card's two metal brackets to the case rear to fasten the card. Some cases have a slot cover that goes on over the brackets before you screw the brackets to the case, in which case use this cover as well. Make sure you don't scratch the motherboard with the video card's metal brackets or other part. If the video card has a power connector slot, connect to this a 6 pin or 8 pin PCI Express power connector from the PSU, matching the slot holes on the video card. More powerful video cards can have two 6 pin or two 8 pin power connectors, in which case connect two connectors. Route this PSU PCI Express wire behind the motherboard if the case has motherboard plate cutouts for wires, otherwise route it around the motherboard behind the main power connector in order to reduce clutter and increase air flow. Install internal adapter card Adding this in case you want to install an internal adapter card, for example a PCI Express wireless adapter if you want your PC to connect to a wireless network instead of a wired network. If not already done so remove from the case rear the metal bracket corresponding to the motherboard's PCI Express x1 slot that is farthest from the PCI Express x16 video card slot. As stated earlier you want to give a video card that you install now or add one in the future as much room as possible for cooling. Insert the adapter card into the slot. Screw the adapter card's metal bracket to the case rear to fasten the adapter to the case. Some cases have a metal cover that goes on over the bracket before you screw the bracket to the case, in which case use this cover as well. Attach any antenna provided with a wireless adapter card to the adapter's inputs at the case rear. As usual make sure you don't scratch the motherboard with the adapter card's metal bracket or other part. Place CurrentBuild Sense PC logo label on case Place CurrentBuild Sense label sticker at center and top of front panel. Test connections Plug in PSU power cord into PSU and to wall outlet and start computer. Use usual precautions when handling electricity! Test to see the following are running - all 3 fans - case, CPU, PSU, (and video card fan(s) if separate video card installed). Test power button (PC comes on and off) and reset button (PC reboots). Test to see all 3 LED lights work - PLED light (power on light that stays on when PC is on), DVD LED light (comes on at start then goes off), HDD LED light (blinks initially). Put back case left, right and front panels Screw back case left and right panels with thumb screws. Make sure you get the sides correctly, a case side panel with a window faces the front side of the motherboard giving the components ventilation.

Static electricity is a topic which is often discussed by first time builders as, after all, an invisible threat which has the potential to do damage to delicate and expensive components is a scary thought. A very commonly asked question is what precautions can be taken and which are necessary. In truth, the vast majority of experienced PC builders do not use grounded wrist straps and similar solutions and simply take basic precautions such as touching a grounded object (for instance the metal case of a plugged in appliance). However it is of note that ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) damage does not have to prevent booting or functionality totally and can cause minor damage which may only be evident as BSODs (Blue Screens of Death) in very specific circumstances.

A method some builders use is to plug in to the wall (but not switch on) your new PSU and touch that periodically in order to discharge any static. It is also recommended that don’t build on carpet and avoid wearing socks or loose fitting clothing.

Parts being broken on arrival or breaking in use is a very rare occurrence, however it definitely can happen. For this reason you will want to keep all packaging and boxes for your parts for the length of their warranties (which can be a very long time depending on the component)

Building a computer from scratch gives you the perfect machine for your needs, but it can be daunting the first time around. In this edition of Lifehacker Night School, we’ll be taking you through the buying, building, and installation process step-by-step. Today, we’re going to start with a little computer hardware basics.

While you could just go to the store and buy a Dell, you might find that you’re happier with a custom-built machine. Building a PC from the ground up means it’s perfectly crafted to fit your needs, whether you’re a hardcore gamer, video editor extraordinaire, or you’re just trying to build a low- or high-powered home theater PC. In some instances, you may save some money, but in all instances you’ll have accomplished a project that you’ll benefit from for years—a pretty great feeling in and of itself. That said, building is much more time consuming than buying, and your first time through, it can be daunting. This week’s Night School series will walk you through building your first (or second, or third) computer from start to finish.


Today, we’ll be talking about the first step in any computer build: brainstorming what kind of machine you’re looking to make and what that means for your hardware.

The Types of Machines and their Ballpark Costs

Much like we did in our original spec-crafting feature, the the first thing you need to do is come up with a very, very rough idea of what kind of performance you want from your machine. The easiest way to do that is to split builds it up into three general categories. We’ve crafted a few example builds for you here, but it’s good to be familiar with these categories:

Low Performance: If you’re looking for a simple PC for web browsing, email checking, or video watching, a low performance machine is probably the way to go. These machines are small, don’t draw a lot of power, and are usually pretty quiet, which is great (though they obviously sacrifice performance for those perks). Nettops, home theater PCs, and (on a more extreme level) home servers also fit into this category. Most custom-built low performance machines range from $200 to $400.
Middle of the Road: This is a great option for the majority of users, especially since you can stretch the machine’s power and your budget to fit almost any scenario. Middle of the road machines will sit in a smaller computer tower, with enough power to play some casual games and run more than a few programs at once. If you’re looking for a multipurpose computer that won’t break the bank, this is where you want to go. Middle of the road machines can vary quite a bit in price, but in general they range from $300 to $700.
High Performance: These are the big guns. Generally, users with high performance computers are doing more resource-intensive tasks: converting and editing large amounts of video, playing the latest and greatest games at high settings, running other operating systems in virtual machines, and so on. Be prepared to shell out a bit of cash, use a lot of electricity, and devote a lot of space to this machine. Again, there’s a good range here, but typically a high performance machine will cost anywhere from $700 to infinity and beyond.
Note that most of those price ranges don’t include extras, like a keyboard and mouse, monitor, speakers, and other such things. Chances are, if you’ve ever owned a computer before, you already have some of those lying around—but if you include them, the price starts to go up quite a bit.


 
We won’t be addressing components like that in this guide; just the actual tower that you’re building. For those other components, see our guides to peripherals and monitors for more.


The Parts That Make Up a Computer (and What They Do)

Every fully-functioning computer is made of the same basic components, and in this section, we’ll walk through the basic hardware you’ll need for your first build. We’re still just talking about “things to consider” here—we’ll get down to the nitty-gritty of picking out specific parts in the next lesson. Here, we just want to point out what the important components are, and which ones are the most important for certain builds.

The Processor


The Processor (CPU) is the “brain” of your computer, the thing that carries out the tasks you give it. Better CPUs can perform more tasks at once, and perform them faster. That said, not everyone actually takes advantage of their processor’s full speed, so the high-end models are only really crucial if you’re performing intensive tasks like video editing, video conversion, compiling code, or (to a lesser extent) gaming. It’s also one of the most expensive parts of a machine, so if you aren’t performing these types of tasks, you definitely don’t need to worry about buying the latest and greatest.

The Motherboard


The motherboard connects all the other components to one another, and is the physical base upon which you build everything else. It contains a lot of your machine’s core features, like the number of USB ports, the number of expansion cards you can put in (such as video, sound, and Wi-Fi), and also partially determines how big your computer will be. Which motherboard you pick will depend on whether you build a low, medium, or high performance machine and how advanced of a user you are.

The Case


The case holds all of your computer’s parts together. For the most part, a case is less about features that affect how your computer runs and more about features that affect you and your home—that is, how quiet it is, how large it is, and of course, how it looks in your office. Still, it’s an important consideration that is dependent on your other choices, so you might want to think about what you want in terms of a case before moving on to the shopping step.

The RAM


RAM, or Random Access Memory (or “Memory” for short), is like your computer’s short-term memory. It stores data your computer needs quick access to to help your programs run faster, and help you run more programs at one time. Thus, if you run a lot of programs at once, you’ll want a computer with more RAM. If you use virtual machines, you’ll want even more RAM, since it has to run its own programs in addition to yours.

The Graphics Card


The Graphics card, or GPU, is a processor specifically designed to handle graphics. It’s what you hook your monitor up to, and it’s what draws your desktop and your windows on the screen. Some motherboards come with a GPU already integrated, which is enough to manage your desktop, but usually not enough for playing 3D games. For those, you’ll need a dedicated graphics card, since it can do the legwork needed to draw those complex images.

The Hard Drive(s)


Your hard drive—not to be confused with memory (RAM)—stores all of your data, ranging from your operating system to your documents, music, and movies. If the RAM is your computer’s short-term memory, your hard drive is the long-term memory. It stores the things you want to keep around for awhile. The kind of hard drive you choose will be determined mainly by how much data you need to store, but certain kinds of hard drives (like solid state drives) can also affect your computer’s speed.

The Optical Drive


An optical drive, more commonly known as a CD or DVD drive, is what you’ll use to read CDs, DVDs, and even Blu-Ray discs. Not everyone needs an optical drive in their computer these days, but since you can buy one for about $20, there’s little reason not to have one.

The Power Supply


The power supply directs electricity to the other components in your machine. Generally speaking, if you have a high performance computer with a fast processor, a graphics card, and a few hard drives, you’ll need a higher wattage power supply than you would if you were building a low-end PC. This is probably the last component you’ll shop for, once you’ve nailed down your other parts and how much electricity they’ll require.

Other Parts to Consider


While these are the main parts almost every computer has, you probably have other needs. For example, if you’re going to use Wi-Fi to access the internet instead of wired Ethernet, you may need to buy a Wi-Fi card. If you take a lot of photos, it’s probably worth getting an internal SD card reader for easily loading your photos onto your computer. If you have any Bluetooth peripherals, you might consider an internal Bluetooth card, and if you video chat with friends, you’ll want to pick up a webcam. And, as we mentioned before, if you don’t already have them, you’ll need a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.You may even want some extra fans or water cooling parts to optimize the cooling in your PC. These are just a few of the extra things you could use, so really think about what you’ll be using this computer for and what other parts you need to buy so you don’t have to take an extra trip to the store (and so you can better budget your money).


Now that you've bought all your components, it's time for the moment of truth: You're ready to actually put together the machine. Assembling your computer can seem daunting, but it's actually pretty easy. Here's what you need to do.

Step Zero: Plan and Test Before You Build



I recommend reading through this guide before you start so you know what you'll need to do, but despite the instructions, I actually recommend building your computer once outside your case before building it inside your case, as discussed in the video above. This will ensure all your components are working before you go through the trouble of screwing everything in.



Building a computer is the best way to get the perfect machine for your needs. We've shown you …

Step One: Mount Your Motherboard


To start, open up your case's box, take out the case, and open it up. Usually this involves unscrewing a few thumb screws on the back of your case and sliding the side panels off. Take a good look around your case and get acquainted; note where the hard drive bays are, where your CD drive will go, whether the power supply mounts on the top or the bottom, and so on. There should also be a bag of screws inside your case; grab that now and set it aside because we'll need it in a few minutes.

Open up your motherboard box and take out the I/O shield, which is the metal plate that protects the ports on the back of your motherboard. You should see a rectangular space in the back of your case where this should go. Snap it into place. This takes quite a bit of force, so make sure all four sides are snapped in securely.

Next, pull out your motherboard and line up the ports on the back with the I/O shield. You should see that the holes on your motherboard line up with screw holes on the bottom of your case. There are probably more holes on your case than there are on your motherboard, so note which ones these are, and grab your motherboard standoffs from your bag of screws (they have a male screw end on one side, and a female screw hole on the other side). Screw the standoffs into those holes, and set your motherboard on top of them. Screw your motherboard screws into the standoffs so the motherboard is snugly mounted.

Note: Many of you have mentioned that you prefer to install the processor, cooler, RAM, and power supply before mounting the motherboard in the case. I've never done this myself, but in some cases, this may be simpler and save you some digging around in your case. I recommend using your motherboard box as a small "bench" for plugging these parts in if you're going to do it separately.

Step Two: Install Your Processor


Open up your processor's box and gently take it out. Your processor is one of the more fragile parts of the build, so this is one step in which you'll want to be careful. Find the coner of your processor that has a gold arrow on it, then look at your motherboard's processor socket for a similar arrowed corner. Line these two arrows up; this is the direction your processor will go into the socket.

Lift up the lever on the processor socket and put your processor in (Intel motherboards might also have a cover you have to lift up first). Pull the lever down to lock it into place. Again, do this gently—it shouldn't require any feats of strength on your part, so if it isn't falling into place easily, something's wrong. Take it out and try re-setting it, make sure your two arrows are lined up, and of course, double check that your motherboard and processor are of the same socket type.


Once your processor's in, grab the cooler that came with your processor (remember, if you got an OEM processor you'll have to buy a cooler separately). It should already have some silver thermal paste on the bottom. If not, you'll need to pick some up from the computer store and put a very thin line on your processor—I usually use about the size of a grain of rice or two, that's all (see the video in Step Zero for more information on this).

Set your cooler on top of your processor. If you have an Intel cooler, you'll need to press down on the four pins until they click. You can find more info on this in your processor's manual (it takes a few tries, trust me). AMD coolers, like the one in the above video, are much easier—just hook the two latches on the sides onto the motherboard's square pegs, and pull the lever down to lock it into place.

Step Three: Install Your RAM


Installing RAM is very simple. Find the RAM sockets on your motherboard, and pull the two clips on the side down. Line up the notch in your RAM stick with the notch in the socket, and press the RAM down into place. This might take a bit of pressure, so don't worry about being overly gentle. The clips should snap back into place when the RAM is fully in the socket.

Step Four: Install Your PCI Cards


For your video card (or any other PCI expansion card), find the topmost slot that fits your card and match that up with its plate on the back of the case. Remove that plate and slide the PCI card's bracket in its place. The card should then be sitting on top of the socket, and all you need to do is press down to lock it into place. Screw the bracket onto the case, and you're good to go.

Note that if you need to remove it for any reason, there may be a small lever on the back of the socket you need to press before you pull it out.

Step Five: Install Your Hard Drive


Every case is a little bit different in how they install hard drives. Generally, there are two methods: on some cases, you have to pull out a hard drive tray, put the drive in, screw it in securely, and then slide the tray back in. Other motherboards just require you to slide the bare drive into the bay and then screw it in snug after the fact. Check your case's manual for more detailed instructions on this particular step.

If you're using multiple hard drives and a big case, it's usually a good idea to leave some open space between them—that is, putting them in the first and third bays instead of first and second. This allows for more airflow between them and will help keep them running cool.

Step Six: Install Your Optical Drive

The optical drive should be pretty self-explanatory. Just pull out the plastic cover on one of your 5.25" drive bays and slide in your optical drive. Screw it into place if necessary.

Step Seven: Mount Your Power Supply


Once everything else is in, it's time to install your power supply and plug everything in. (Note that if your case came with a power supply, you can skip this step, as it'll already be installed). It should be pretty obvious where your power supply goes, as there will be a big rectangular hole on the back of your case. Some power supplys mount on the top, while some sit on the bottom of the case. Generally, they mount with the fan facing away from the edge of the case, unless that case has enough space in between the power supply mount and the end of the case to allow for airflow.

Once you set it into place, you should see the holes on the back of the case line up with the screw holes in the power supply. Screw it into place and you're all set.

Note: Many of you have recommended installing your power supply before installing all the other items. I've personally never done this, but depending on your case, it may be ideal. Once again, plan before you build!

Step Eight: Plug Everything In

This can be the most tedious and difficult part of the process, depending on your case and power supply. Separate the cords coming out of your power supply and plug them in individually. You should have:


A 24-pin Motherboard Cable: This is the biggest cable on the power supply, which gives the motherboard the electricity it needs to run. It has the very long plug with, you guessed it, 24 little pins in it. Most cases should have a 20-pin with a 4-pin on the same cable, so you can just put them together and plug them into the big 24-pin socket on your motherboard. It should lock into place, and might take a bit of strength to get it in all the way. Push it in until you hear the click and you can't pull it out with just a slight tug.

A 4-pin Motherboard Cable: You should also have a separate 4-pin cable coming out of your power supply, and a small 4-pin socket somewhere else on the motherboard. This plugs in the same was as the 24-pin cable—just push down until it locks into place.

6-pin PCI Cables: If you have a rather powerful graphics card, you might have to plug it into your power supply. This requires the 6-pin "PCI" cable coming from your power supply, which should look similar to the 24-pin and 4-pin cables. Plug it into the end of your video card. Note that not all video cards require these cables, so if it doesn't have a socket, you can leave it be.

SATA Power and Data Cables: Your hard drives and optical drive plug in via SATA, which contains two cables. One is the skinny black plug coming out of your power supply, which gives power to those drives. The other is a small red cable that should have come with your motherboard; this is the SATA cable that actually transfers data between your hard drive and everything else.

Plug the power cable into the long pin on your hard drive, and plug the data cable into the short pin. The sockets are L-shaped, so they'll only go in one way. After plugging both cables into the drive, be sure to plug the other end of the data cable into your motherboard, in the sockets labeled SATA. Repeat this entire process with your optical drive.


Molex Power Cables: Your Molex cables power other miscellaneous things in your build, like the case fans. Take the plugs connected to your case fans and plug the male side into the female molex cable on your power supply. This takes a bit of force to get in, and even more force to get out (seriously, these are my least favorite cables of all time).

Note that some fans, like the one on your CPU, might have a smaller connector that actually plugs into your motherboard instead of the power supply instead of via Molex. The small headers will be labled CPU_FAN or SYS_FAN. If they're three pronged, they'll power your fans, but if your CPU cooler has a four-pronged fan plug then you'll also be able to control its speed from some programs.


Front Panel Audio, USB, and FireWire Connectors: Most cases have a few ports on the front, which can include but are not limited to USB, FireWire, headphone, and microphone jacks. You should see some small cables coming out of the front of your case labeled things like USB, HD AUDIO, and 1394 (which is FireWire). Plug these into their corresponding 8-pin headers on the motherboard—usually labeled USB, AUD, and 1394, or something of the sort.

Power Switch and LED Connectors: Lastly, you should have a few small cables labeled POWER SW, RESET SW, HDD LED, and so on. These connect the switches and LEDs on the front of your case to the motherboard, so you can actually turn your computer on. They all consist of only one or two pins, and all plug in on an 8-pin header somewhere on the motherboard. This varies from build to build, so you'll have to check your motherboard's manual to see how they all plug in. Your motherboard may also have a small speaker that plugs into an 8-pin connector, which you'll find in your motherboard box and will be listed in your motherboard's manual.

A Note on Cable Management



As you're doing all this, you want to be wary of where you're putting these cables. Generally, you want to keep them as out of the way as possible. The more they're tangled up in the middle of your case, the more they're going to block airflow from your fans, causing your computer to run hotter, louder, and possibly even overheat. Your case may have come with some zip ties to help you wrap them up and get them out of the way. Some cases even come with built-in cable management features, like clips or holes through which you route these cables to keep them out of the way.

Cable management is a beast unto its own, and it differs from case to case, so it's just something you'll have to fiddle with. I could do an entire night school on cable management, but I won't. If you have a particularly complicated build where a few simple zip ties won't suffice, I recommend checking out NCIX Tech Tip's cable management guide, shown above, which will take you through some more advanced cable management techniques.

The Final Step: Turn It On


When you're done, plug in the power cable in the back, flip the power switch on, and press the power button on the front of your case. If all goes well, your computer should turn on and, if you plug a monitor into your video card (or motherboard, if you don't have a video card), you should see what's called the POST screen. From there, you can head into your BIOS setup by pressing a key on your keyboard (usually Delete).

At this point, it's probably time to start cleaning up. I usually don't throw anything away but the actual garbage. I keep all the screws, brackets, and miscellaneous pieces I didn't use in the motherboard's box, and that becomes my "build box". That way, in future builds, or if I upgrade that build, I always have extras of everything on hand just in case. It's come in handy on more than one occasion, so I can't recommend this enough if you have any pieces left over.

Common Troubleshooting

If your computer didn't turn on, don't panic. First, recheck everything inside. Is your processor seated correctly? If your RAM all the way in its socket? Are your cables plugged into the right sockets? (this is a big one). Run through the entire process again to make sure you did everything correctly.

If your system turns on but makes a beeping noise instead of going through the POST screen, then you have an error. If you can find your motherboard's BIOS manufacturer (either by watching the POST screen or by searching online), you can diagnose these error codes to find out what's wrong with your system using these pages:

Also remember that Google is an extremely useful tool. If you're having issues but can't figure out what's wrong, try searching the net or posting on a computer building forum like Reddit's /r/buildapc. If nothing seems to help, you might have a faulty piece of hardware, like your power supply or motherboard, and you should go about exchanging it for something that works. I wouldn't jump to this conclusion too quickly, though—dig around in your case and do some research to make sure you didn't just plug something in incorrectly.

Once you've got a working computer, congratulations! You're in the home stretch, now—all you need to do is install an operating system. We'll come back to that tomorrow, but in the meantime, bask in the gloriousness of your accomplishment—it took a lot of work to get here, and you should feel good about yourself.

Open your computer case. Remove both side panels for easy access to the motherboard tray. The motherboard tray can be removed from the case, which will allow you to easily install the motherboard without having to work at weird angles. Not all cases have removable motherboard trays.
The motherboard tray is typically held in with two screws. Set these aside so that you don’t lose them.
Installing a motherboard typically means you are essentially building a new computer. You will need to reinstall your operating system if you are upgrading, and you will need to format any system drives. You cannot simply upgrade to a new motherboard without reinstalling everything on your computer.

Ground yourself. Before you begin working on the interior of your computer or handling the motherboard, make sure you discharge any electrostatic charge you may have. You can touch a water tap to discharge your electrostatic charge.
Wear an antistatic wrist strap while working on the computer to prevent causing electrostatic damage.

Replace the I/O panel shield. This is located at the rear of the case, where the connectors for the motherboard extend out for your monitor, USB devices, and other peripherals. Most cases have a default panel shield installed, which will need to be removed and replaced with the panel that came with your motherboard.[1]
Apply pressure to all four corners of the panel to secure it into the case. It should snap into place.
Make sure that you are installing the panel in the correct direction. Compare it to the actual layout of the connectors on the motherboard to make sure it is going in the right way.

Find the standoffs. Standoffs keep the motherboard above the case. This prevents it from shorting out and helps cooling. Some cases will come with standoffs, while others do not. Your motherboard should come with its own standoffs as well that you can use.

Install the standoffs. Match the holes on the motherboard with the available standoff locations on the motherboard tray. Every case and motherboard tray is different, and all will have different hole configurations. Line up the motherboard to see where you can use standoffs to secure it. Every hole possible on your motherboard should have a standoff installed.
Most standoffs screw into their holes, but some are pushed in like pegs.
Not all motherboards will be able to attach with all of the available holes. Connect as many standoffs as possible, but never use any extra standoffs. Standoffs should only be installed in locations with a corresponding motherboard hole.[2]

Place your motherboard on the standoffs. The holes and the standoffs should all line up. If your motherboard tray does not come out of the case, you may need to gently force the motherboard against the I/O panel on the back of the case to fit it. Start securing the motherboard with screws.
Don’t overtighten the screws. Make sure it is firm but not too tight. Do not use an electric screwdriver.
Holes that don’t have metal on them will need cardboard washers between the screw and the motherboard. It is best to avoid using non-metallic holes at all.

Install your components. Before reinserting the motherboard tray with the newly-fastened motherboard into the case, install your CPU, CPU cooler, and RAM. Doing this now will make it much easier to reach everything. If your motherboard is not on a removable tray, install your components after wiring.

Connect the power supply. Once the motherboard is secured, you can start connecting your components to it. It is recommended that you connect the power supply first, as the plugs will be difficult to reach later. Make sure that both the 20/24-pin connector is attached as well as the 4/8-pin 12V connector.
Refer to your power supply’s documentation if you are unsure which cables to use.

Connect your front panel. In order to turn on your computer with the front power button or see when the hard drive is being accessed, you will need to connect the front panel switches and indicators. Locate the following wires and connect them to the appropriate pins on the motherboard:

Connect the front USB ports. Connect any front USB ports to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard. These are typically labeled. Make sure the correct plugs are placed on the correct pints.

Connect the fans. Connect any case and CPU fans to the appropriate pins on the motherboard. There are typically several places to plug in chassis fans, as well as a two-pin connector near the CPU for the CPU fan.

Install your drives. Once the motherboard is secure and connected, you can start attaching your drives to it. Make sure that you attach your SATA hard drives and optical drives to the correct SATA ports on your motherboard.

Install a video card. One of the last components you should install is the video card. The card will take up the most space, and will make reaching other areas difficult. Installing a video card may be optional, depending on your system and needs.

Adjust your wiring. Now that everything is connected to your motherboard, it’s time to move that wiring around so that heat doesn’t get trapped or wires don’t get stuck in fans. Tuck excess cable into spare drive bays and use zip ties to bundle cables together. Make sure that all of your components have room to breathe.[3]

Close up the computer. Return the side panels of the case to their original positions and screw them back in. Plug your computer and components in. Turn your computer on and prepare for operating system installation. Follow the guides below for specific instructions for your operating system:
