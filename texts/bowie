
Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 

[CHORUS]
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 

[CHORUS]
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 

Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 

He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother


La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 

Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

[CHORUS]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away

Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

[CHORUS]
See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's a memory of the summer day

[CHORUS (twice)]
La la la la la la [repeat]


Rubber band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long

And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber band, you're playing my tunes out of tune, oh

Rubber band, Won't you play a haunting theme again to me

While I eat my scones and drink my cup 
of tea

The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme

Rubber band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon I'd find my love

Rubber band
In '14-'18 war I went to sea 
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me

And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
[spoken]
Oh sob: I hope you break your baton


Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum [x4]

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch

Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance

If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum [x7]
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me

I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday

Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday [x2]
Da da da dum [x11]

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday


There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there Mr. Grownup,
Go away sir
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite

Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry

Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky

Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away

Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away sir
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Here is the news
According the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

My studies include suffragy
I formed my own society
To study the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah 

[CHORUS]
We are not your friends 
We don't give a damn for what you're saying 
We're here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops of few, the cattle gun
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your 
Messiah

[CHORUS]
[spoken]
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their 
allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is :
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide 

[CHORUS]
You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

[CHORUS]
We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you


When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you

Happy at the sound of your voice

Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever

When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 

And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 

Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me

Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave 
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream


War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade

Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days

Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear, caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again


Montains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not down
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die 
La la la la la la la la la la [x2]
La la la la la [x2]
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
Child of the Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue


Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
You've watched your father plough the field with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threshed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red


Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong 
Cause she can't switch off, now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the band 
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke 
This is how to spend now that you've joined a gang 
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang


She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks 
on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped 
her back 
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
She's got medals
Her mother called her Mary, she changed her name to Tommy,
she's a one, oh 
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
She's got medals
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down
She's got medals


This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the picture of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 

Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn't have worldly cares

Maids of Bond street shouldn't have love affairs


There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Til the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand

He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care 
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair

And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay

And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes myself
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"


Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills 
and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, 
engines on
Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you

[spoken]
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

This is Ground Control 
to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
if you dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating 
in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much 
she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead,
there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

Here am I floating 
round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do.


Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last

It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the Cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths 
of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm Unwashed 
and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange Unwashed and Happily Slightly Dazed.


The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and 
read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure 
what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you


I bless you madly, 
sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, 
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you 
that sets the test

So much has gone 
and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

"I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart 
to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts 
to be free?
Words of strength and care 
and sympathy
I opened doors
that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide, 
for little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility 
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"

I bless you madly, 
sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time,
at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you 
that sets the test

So much has gone
and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
on slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe"

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore 
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live
Live
Live


Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash
my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all


I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer 
bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I can't touch your name

For the days of fate 
were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine


Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

"It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always 
really free"

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
from Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy 
from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
"Stop, Freecloud 
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain
Track.


I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
"God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today"

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly 
for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling 
wooden floor

Crying
"God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
the other way

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
the other way"


The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love
upon a white balloon
And fly it from 
the topest top of all the tops 
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something 
just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through 
the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

"The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party."


In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.

And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be

And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind

Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag

And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around,go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around,go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply

And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed

Waiting for you


Day after day 
They send my friends away 
To mansions cold and grey 
To the far side of town 
Where the thin men stalk the streets 
While the sane stay underground 

Day after day 
They tell me I can go 
They tell me I can blow 
To the far side of town 
Where it's pointless to be high 
'Cause it's such a long way down 
So I tell them that 
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm 

I will do me harm 
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all...am I? 

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be 
Just my librium and me 
And my E.S.T. makes three 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free 

And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me 

(Where can the horizon lie 
When a nation hides 
Its organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim) 

Day after day 
They take some brain away 
Then turn my face around 
To the far side of town 
And tell me that it's real 
Then ask me how I feel 

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all 
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be 
My libido's split on me 
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen 
Roaming free And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content 
They're all as sane as me

Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock

You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock

Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu


Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo

There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo

We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, 
From paradise 
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball. 
Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo 

After all, after all


I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues


President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge

So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me

Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away

Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying

Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away

Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine


We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins

I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying

Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around

So she didn't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold


We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed

I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long long time ago

Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World


When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives

Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers

Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold.

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries 

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies


I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
And every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace
I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time


Wake up you sleepy head 
Put on some clothes,
shake up your bed 
Put another log on the fire for me 
I've made some breakfast and coffee 
Look out my window and what do I see 
A crack in the sky 
and a hand reaching down to me 
All the nightmares came today 
And it looks as though they're
here to stay 
What are we coming to 
No room for me,
no fun for you 
I think about a world to come 
Where the books were found 
by the Golden ones 
Written in pain, written in awe 
By a puzzled man who questioned 
What we were here for 
All the strangers came today 
And it looks as though
they're here to stay 

[CHORUS:]
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Let me make it plain
([second time:] Let me say it again)
You gotta make way 
for the Homo Superior 

Look at your children 
See their faces in golden rays 
Don't kid yourself they belong to you 
They're the start of a coming race 
The earth is a bitch 
We've finished our news 
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use 
All the strangers came today 
And it looks as though they're here to stay 

[CHORUS]


The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins 
the branches to the sky


It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus:]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]

Dring-dring-dring.

(Mind the phone)


[CHORUS (x2)]
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things 
to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people 
when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

[CHORUS]

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up 
this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies 
or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

[CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)]


I'm closer to the Golden Dawn 
Immersed in Crowley's uniform 
Of imagery 
I'm living in a silent film 
Portraying 
Himmler's sacred realm 
Of dream reality 
I'm frightened by the total goal 
Drawing to the ragged hole 
And I ain't got the power anymore 
No I ain't got the power anymore 

I'm the twisted name 
on Garbo's eyes 
Living proof of 
Churchill's lies 
I'm destiny 
I'm torn between the light and dark 
Where others see their targets 
Divine symmetry 
Should I kiss the viper's fang 
Or herald loud
the death of Man 
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore

[CHORUS]
Don't believe in yourself 
Don't deceive with belief 
Knowledge comes
with death's release 

I'm not a prophet 
or a stone age man 
Just a mortal 
with the potential of a superman 
I'm living on 
I'm tethered to the logic 
of Homo Sapien 
Can't take my eyes 
from the great salvation 
Of bullshit faith 
If I don't explain what you ought to know 
You can tell me all about it 
On, the next Bardot
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore

[CHORUS]


Fill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your Mind
Only in your Mind-Forget your Mind
And you'll be free-yea'
The writing's on the wall
Free-yea'. And you can know it all
If you choose. Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are Free of thoughts unpure [sic]
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it Free.

Happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your Head
Only in your Head
Fear is in your Head
Only in your Head
So Forget your Head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free-yea'. And you can know it all
If you choose. Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it Free!!

Free-yea'. Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah [repeat]


Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up 
just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[CHORUS]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint 
and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[CHORUS]


Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man 
called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, Here she comes...[etc.]

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while
down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So they're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, Here she comes....[etc.]


I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
to pull sister Flo
My heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low

'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

[CHORUS]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it,
she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen,
and such are queens
That your laughter
is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
why didn't I say, no, no, no

[CHORUS]

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[CHORUS]


And so the story goes 
they wore the clothes
They said the things
to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie
like they hope it was
And the Goodmen of Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn
were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep
to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream,
and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old
and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo!
it was midnight
Back o' the kitchen door
Like the grim face
on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

And it was Stalking time
for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers

Now the dress is hung,
the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Camelian, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
"Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky"
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion

Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey! [repeat ad inf.]


Pushing thru the market 
square
so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, 
we had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us 
earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse
it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things 
to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
and a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
We've got five years, that's all we've got


Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life 
to save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts

To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[CHORUS]
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenceless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness 
evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

[CHORUS]


I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, 
you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love

Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care

Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah! 

Freak out, far out, in out


Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, 
he said

Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

[CHORUS]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV 
we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light

If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[CHORUS (x2)]

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la


When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round 

[CHORUS]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down 

Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

[CHORUS]

Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something 
too

[CHORUS (x2)]


People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace

The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[CHORUS]
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight 
([second time:] really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey

Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

[CHORUS]

Oh how I sighed 
When they asked if I knew his name

[CHORUS]

Get some pussy now!


Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile 
as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that 
he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[CHORUS (x2)]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation 
as a rock & roll star
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like 
a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night 
as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right 
as a rock & roll star


Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the 
show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh 
collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams

[CHORUS]
So come on, come on 
we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself

We can't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders from Mars

[CHORUS (x3)]

Come on, ah, come on, ah [repeat ad inf.]


Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Wierd and Gilly,
And The Spiders from Mars.
He played it left hand, but made it too far,
Became the special man,
Then we were Ziggy's Band.

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Here came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us.
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass,
He was the naz
With God given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar.

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Ziggy played guitar


Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick 
Just put my spine out of place

Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

[CHORUS]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes
Here she comes

[CHORUS]

A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City [x2]
Suffragette City 

Ohhh, Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am!

Suffragette City [ad lib]


Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your 
cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it

And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived 
too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suciide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road

But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone 

Just turn on with me and you're not alone 
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful [x2]
Oh gimme your hands.


Shakey threw a party 
that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band 
of married men
Looking up to me 
for encouragement 
- it was so-so

The ladies looked bad 
but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better 
- it was so-so

Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

[CHORUS]
Watch that man!3 Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and 
spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman 1fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits3were joking 
the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled
with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played 
the Tiger Rag3 
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

[CHORUS]

Watch that man [repeat ad inf.]


Watching him dash away, 
swinging an old bouquet 
- dead roses
Sake and strange divine Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, 
takes him away to war - 
don't fake it
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you'll make it

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, 
just in case of sunrise

Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, 
just in case of sunrise

Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
We'll love Aladdin Sane


Let me put my arms 
around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see
if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes
and scored
Like the video films we saw

[CHORUS]
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation 
amid this fall out saturation

Cursing at the Astronette 8
Who stands in steel 
by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply 
for ageing men

With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Which once had raised a sea
that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

[CHORUS]
It's a Drive-in Saturday [repeat]


He looked a lot like Che Guevara, 
drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion,
such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening 
gloom
The police had warned of repercussions

They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher
crouching in his overalls

I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, 
made a run back home

Found him slumped across the table. 
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit. 
He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust." 
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit


I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had

I'm stiff on my legend, 
the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 
cause you just got paid

[CHORUS]
Crack, baby, crack, 
show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck,
give me your head
Before you start professing 
that you're knocking me dead

You caught yourself a trick down 
on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
you're a porcupine

You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

[CHORUS]


Time - He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys

Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, 
and many other last names
I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
"Oh God I'm still alive"

We should be on by now [x2]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la [repeat]

You - are not a victim
You - just scream with boredom
You - are not evicting time

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, 
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you 
dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. 
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, 
smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now [x5]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la [repeat]

Yeah, time!


Cold fire, you've got everything 
but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tired
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart in pieces

[CHORUS]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might 
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

[CHORUS]

One day though it might
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star


Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry 
I can take my time
I'm going red 
and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

[CHORUS]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong
that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around 
and around

[CHORUS]

Oh, You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

[CHORUS]

This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, heh
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever [x3]

Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love 
was no fun
But our love 
comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!

[CHORUS]


A small Jean Genie
snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers 
and slash back blazers
Ate all your razors 
while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe 
and walking on Snow White 19
New York's a go-go 19
and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie

[CHORUS]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

Sits like a man 
but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but 
just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, 
won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician
and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair 
for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[CHORUS]

He's so simple minded 
he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

[CHORUS (x2)]


She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become 
her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end [repeat]


Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn

[VERSE]
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
It's so hard to say goodnight
It's you that I love now can't you see?

[CHORUS]
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn

[VERSE]

[CHORUS]

Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ah


Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)

I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her 
like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

[CHORUS]
Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept 
the fact she's chosen him 
And simply let them be?

[CHORUS]

Oh she's with him 
they're turning down the lights
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes 
and telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

[CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)]


Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving
won't do me no good

Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do?
Turning on me and some other men too

Come back baby give me one more chance
You know I still love
you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance all night long
In my arms, oh yeah

[CHORUS]

Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah [repeat ad inf.]


Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til 
tomorrow

[CHORUS]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

[CHORUS]

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily

[CHORUS]


Oh, little baby
You know I've been away
Oh, little baby
You know I'll come today
Don't you know that

Everything's alright 
(everything's alright)
Everything's alright 
Everything's alright 
(everything's alright, babe)

Let me hold your hand and be your loving man (all night)

Let me hold your hand and be your loving man (all night)

Let me hold your hand and be your loving man (all night, alright!)

Oh, little baby
You know I feel so good
Oh, little baby
I never knew I could
And don't you know that

Everything's alright
(everything's alright, babe)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright 
(everything's alright, babe)
Let me give you loving like nobody can 
(all night) [x2]
Let me give you loving like nobody can
(all night, alright!)

Let me hold your hand and be your loving man 

No, no, no, no, no, that's a-loving you
(Must have been you,
I'm gonna all night loving you)
No, no, no, no, no
I'll be good for you

Everything's alright 
(everything's alright, babe)
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
(everything's alright, babe)
Let me give you loving like nobody can 
(all night) [x2]
Let me give you loving like nobody can 
(all night, alright!)

Everything's alright
Everything's alright
Oooh


New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down in my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain


Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just don't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

[CHORUS]
(See my baby)
Gonna have fun in the city 
(feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw)
Be with my girl 
she's so pretty
(all I want to do)
(I'll go crazy)
She looks fine tonight
(zoom zoom zoom) 
She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)

There is nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar 
man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind

[CHORUS]

(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl [repeat ad lib.]


With your long blonde hair
and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you 
was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying 
to spend my money

You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me
you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh

I tried to find her
'Cause I can't resist her 
(I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair


I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think 
this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 
'cause someone new

And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll ?settle down?
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll ?settle down?
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down


Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same

[CHORUS]
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

[CHORUS]

Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind


[CHORUS]
I can go anyway 
(way I choose)
I can live anyhow 
(win or lose)
I can go anywhere 
(for something new)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

I can do anything 
(right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow 
(and get along)
I don't care anyway 
(I never lose)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines
that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

[CHORUS]

Anyway, anyway I choose
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself, 
Anyway, anyway I choose


In my life I've never stopped 
to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out 
and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long

[CHORUS]
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride 
and always felt the same
Time was on our side 
and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys

[CHORUS]

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground

[CHORUS]


And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red, mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coverting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now 
The Year of the Diamond Dogs

"This ain't Rock'n'Roll
This is Genocide"


As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party

With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
mannequins with kill appeal

[CHORUS]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase

The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake

Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized

[CHORUS]

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the Ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[CHORUS]

Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs [x2]
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs [ad lib]

Keep cool - Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Beware of the Diamond Dogs [repeat]


It's safe in the city, to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?

Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says

[CHORUS]
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap
thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment

If his trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...

[CHORUS]


I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate

We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a
street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up

Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there?
Any time?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind

But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright

I guess we could cruise down one more time

With you by my side, it should be fine

We'll buy some drugs and watch a band

Then jump in the river holding hands


If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted

It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you


You've got your mother in a whirl 
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl

Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[CHORUS]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

Don't ya?

[CHORUS]

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

So what you wanna know Calamity's child, 
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?


You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet

I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

[CHORUS]
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting 
I've found a door which lets me out!

[CHORUS (x3)]


Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way

People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are papers, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today

I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night

Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared

Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell

And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said

We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead


Someday they won't let you, so now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, 
and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's neverthere
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

[CHORUS]
Come see, come see, remember me?

We played out an all night movie role

You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled

In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side

I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65

Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

[CHORUS]

1984 [ad lib]


Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal

We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, we can really begin

Please savior, save your shores
Tell me I'm rapidly yours

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to save us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother
Big Brother!

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone, and you've been anywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose, if I knew what's going down

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us - some brave Apollo!
Someone to save us, someone like you

We want you Big Brother


Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro...


They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I
still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[CHORUS (She)]
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture
window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford
Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for 
nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

[CHORUS (She)]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

[CHORUS (HE)]
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American, 
he wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you

[CHORUS (YOU)]
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more? 
And, ain't there a woman I can 
sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?

[CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times ad lib)]
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American


Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

[CHORUS]
Now your smile is wearing (spreading?) thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

[CHORUS]
Now your smile is wearing (spreading?) thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win


Got to use her
Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to 
use her
Every time I think of what she pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya

[CHORUS]
(Fascination) fascination
(sho 'nuff) fascination
(takes a part of me) takes 
a part of me
(Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat
(live in a fever) live in a fever?
(raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(oh, yeah) oh yeah
(takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(every time, ooh)
Fascination comes around

(Ooh-oo-ooh)
(Fascination) Your soul is calling

Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick

Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back

He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says "I'm somebody"
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race

He says "I'm somebody"
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like) 
Where they've been

[CHORUS 2]
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
Leaders come, they hate all the people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?
Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well

Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)
Somebody, somebody, somebody

[Written by John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
[Originally performed by The Beatles in the album "Let It Be"]

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup 
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[CHORUS (twice)]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a 
Million eyes
They call me on and on 
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my 
open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

[CHORUS (twice)]


Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ohh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm Faking it all

[CHORUS]
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I, what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

[CHORUS]
Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside (I do)
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love
Show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)

Take it in right to your love life, baby
Take it in right to your love life
Take it in right, take it in right, right to your love life

Fame, makes a man take things over

Fame, puts you there where things are hollow

That burns your change to keep you insane

Fame, what you get is no tomorrow

To bind your time, it drives you to, crime

Everybody's raised in blindness
Everybody knows it's true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anybody's point of view

Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same

Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be real? (Somebody real)

Hmmm, if it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see, a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you

Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Oh-oh, could we, could we make a star to snatch their angels, boy
Played your role for every day

Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real? Can I be?

Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell upon, you found me

Yeah, yeah

Hey Jack, I better shake it off, put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother, I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God, was it really yesterday?

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm
Gonna love her way

Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, I gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby

That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh, but I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Looking for love won't hold me back
No, I'm gonna love her way

Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, I gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby

That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
No, no, no

I see her now a little tear running down her cheek
Lost, let down, people looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard

Hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby

My kind of love, can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
Yeah, baby, baby, yeah, I'll give you baby, baby, baby
'Cos it's gonna be me, it's gonna be me

Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be a double
You are the same
Here it comes again

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your lines
Waiting for something better to shine
Take that same okay

After today, fortune man will find you
After today, they will find you working
After today, you'll find the ones you're after
After today, look out, after today

What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it, baby boy? For me
Break that heart for me

After today, the fortune fan will find you
After today, they will fly you away
After today, you'll find the one you're after
After today, look out, after today

After today, the fortune fan will find you
After today, they will fly you away
After today, you'll find the one you're after
After today, look out, after today

Today
After today
After today, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah

The return of the Thin White Duke 
throwing darts
in lovers' eyes 
Here are we one magical moment
Such is the stuff from 
where dreams are woven
Bending sound
Dredging the ocean lost in my circle
Here am I
Flashing no colour tall in this room 
overlooking the ocean

Here are we
One magical movement 
from Kether to Malkuth 1 
There are you
You drive like a demon 
from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke 
throwing darts 
in lovers' eyes [x2]
The return of the Thin White Duke, 
making sure white stains

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds
to soar with
And once I could 
never be down
Got to keep searching 
and searching
Oh what will I be believing 
and who will connect me with love?

Wonder who wonder who
wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass
raise your glass high

[CHORUS 1]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late 
- to be grateful
It's too late 
- to be late again
It's too late 
- to be hateful
The european cannon is here

[CHORUS 2]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass 
without her
It's too late 
- to be grateful
It's too late 
- to be late again
It's too late 
- to be hateful
The European cannon is here

[CHORUS 3]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show 
some kind of glow?
It's too late
- to be grateful
It's too late
- to be late again
It's too late
- to be hateful
The european cannon is here, yes it's here

It's too late [5 times]
The European cannon is here

[CHORUS 1]

[CHORUS 2]

[CHORUS 3]

It's too late [repeat ab inf]


Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 

Don't let me hear you say life's 
taking you nowhere,
angel

Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby

[CHORUS]
There's my baby lost that's all
Once I'm begging 
you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up my baby

Last night they loved you,
opening doors
and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, 
act fine
Come get up my baby

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down 
where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car 
twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet,
don't break my heart
Doing all right,
but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby

[CHORUS]

Don't let me hear you say life's 
taking you nowhere, 
angel

Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop [Repeat]


In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life
out of my dreams
I don't need another change 
Still you forced away 
into my scheme of things

You say we're growing,
growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life
out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything 
in heaven or hell

[CHORUS]
Lord, I kneel and offer you 
my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit 
among your scheme of things

It's safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies
like a word on a wing

My prayer flies 
like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in 
with your scheme of things?

In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life 
out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

Ooh, ready to shape 
the scheme of things [5 times]

[CHORUS]


Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention 
to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, 
he's got more channels
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my T V C one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five
Oh, so demonic, 
oh my T V C one five

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading 

"Send back 
my dream test baby, 
She's my main feature"
My T V C one five, he, he just 
Stares back unblinking
So hologramic,
oh my T V C one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby, then

We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
My baby's in there someplace
Love's rating in the sky
So hologramic,
oh my T V C one five

This week dragged past me 
so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could 
get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[CHORUS]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, 
make me delight
Right is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is 
stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody 
Wants something or wants to stay 

[CHORUS]


Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress, satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[CHORUS]
You touch me, 
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself!

Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

[CHORUS]

Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind


Baby, I've been
breaking glass 
In your room again
Listen 

Don't look at the carpet,
I drew something awful on it

See

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you


You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, 
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait 
until the crowd goes
Oh, wait 
until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

So deep in your room, 
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?
To the real me 
to the real me

Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh [repeat ad inf.]


Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, 
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude,
over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision


Every chance, 
every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometres and the red lights
I was always looking left and right
Oh, but I'm always crashing 
in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94
Oh, but I'm always crashing
in the same car


Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place 

Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

Sometimes you get so lonely

Weaving down a byroad,
singing the song
That's my kind of highroad, 
gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no
to the Beauty and the Beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no 
to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
You can't say no
to the Beauty and the Beast 
(Weakling)
My-my
You can't say no

I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should

My-my

Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank god heaven left us
Standing on our feet

Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no

Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are 
if you nail me to my car"

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams 
You get up and sleep

You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight

You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car 
and I'll tell you who you are" [x2]

You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, 
just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing,
nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, 
just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads
(over our heads)
And we kissed, 
as though nothing could fall
(nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, 
just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, 
then you better not stay
But we could be safer, 
just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, 
just for one day


Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms
blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows 
of city limits
Lay in bed coming
and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms
like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two 
then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

[CHORUS]
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's find another way down
(sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in 
(sons of sound and sons of sound)

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy 
and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars 
and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once 
but dream and dream
They don't walk, 
they just glide in and out of life
They never die, 
they just go to sleep one day

[CHORUS]

(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!


Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile
on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage

Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood 
and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, 
stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, 
nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets 
(get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)

While the streets block off 
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(get some protection)
Get me on my feet 
(get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
(get some protection)


The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes
at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie 
the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song 
when the heroine dies

Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green


In the event
that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion 
and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world,
but nobody's perfect

It's a moving world, 
but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?


African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman 
I went too far
Bent on a windfall 
rent a sony

Wonder 
how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well

Seemed like another day
I could fly 
into the eye of god on high

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days

Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff
skimming over Rhino

Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child 
whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine

Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

Seemed like another day
I could fly 
into the eye of god on high

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days

Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana


Sometimes I feel
That I need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Can't forget you
Can't forget you


[CHORUS]
Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - 
Just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - 
But such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

[CHORUS]

Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love 
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin


Feel a bit roughed up, 
feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action
wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

Thunder ocean
Thunder ocean
Red sails take me, 
make me sail along

Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails
Red sails

Do you remember we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall keep us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

Red sails
Thunder ocean
Red sails
Sailor can't dance like you

Red sail
Red sail action
Red sail
Some reaction

Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along
Life stands still and stares

We're gonna sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da

I'm home, lost my job,

You think this is easy realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing

I think she's dancing, what do I know?

I am a D.J., I am what I play

Can't turn around no, can't turn around

I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

One more weekend of lights 
and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around,
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)

Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

I've got believers 
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.


"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
see it in my eyes
Till you come

No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
feel it in my voice
Till you come

(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)

Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy

Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy

They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out


Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cause the chevy's real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
(Don't hit her)

"Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?"

Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show 
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

Shows through
Shows through
Shows through


Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?

Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along

Reet Petite and how d'ya do
Then I got the small red box

And I knew I must not drop it

I am bored from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday,
and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain,
and it makes all the papers 2

So where's the moral
when people have their fingers broken2
To be insulted by these fascists 
it's so degrading
And it's no game

Shut up! Shutu


The vacuum created 
by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling 
witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled
it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it

More idols than realities
I'm OK, you're so-so

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo


She had an horror of rooms 
she was tired 
you can't hide beat 
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home

She could've been a killer 
if she didn't walk the way she do, 
and she do
She opened strange doors
that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

[CHORUS (twice)]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay 
and I stole her room
She asked for my love 
and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl 
and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound
jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

[CHORUS (twice)]

[CHORUS (twice)]

Run, Run, Run [ad lib]


Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy. Hope you're happy, too.
I've loved. All I've needed: love.
Sordid details following."

The shrieking of nothing is killing me
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

[Chorus:]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh, no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy. Hope you're happy, too."
One flash of light
But no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue,
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

[Chorus]

[4x]
My mama said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom."


There's a brand new dance
but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes 
do again and again
It's big and it's bland 
full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

[CHORUS]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad 
and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk,
but it's not very clear
That people from good homes 
are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless 
and I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing 
on the whole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

[CHORUS]

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la


Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise 
of something hard to do
A real life adventure
worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above
and sun on your arms 
strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions 
everywhere you go
Blinded with desire 
- guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, 
search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open
your million dollar weapon
And you push , still you push, 
still you push your luck

A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys9 

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending
it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece 
of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes

The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
You're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground
like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time 
at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece 
of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece 
of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen 
and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove 
that you coudn't pass the test
There'll be others 
on the line filing past, 
who'll whisper low
I miss you he really had to go
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Wild 
Wild
Wild


Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 
'cause he was like me

[CHORUS]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains,
and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning 
to be a part of soc-society

[CHORUS]

No athletic program, 
no discipline, no book

He just sat in the backseat
swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

[CHORUS (twice)]


Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries 
"It's all in vain"
The voice of doom 
was shining in my room
I just need one day 
somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Well the river's so muddy,
but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night,
I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

[CHORUS]

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high

Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
When the kingdom comes


Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy 
don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
she can't talk any more

What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides
like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

[CHORUS]
Because you're young 
you'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young -
what could be nicer for you 
and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard 
was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides 
like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

[CHORUS]

A million dreams
A million scars
A million [repeat ad inf.]


Silhouettes and shadows
watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees, 
couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road,
and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, 
and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, 
and it makes all the papers

And it's no game

Children round the world,
put camel shit on the walls

They're making carpets on treadmills,
or garbage sorting

And it's no game


I know when to go out 
And when to stay in 
Get things done [spoken]

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern Love walks beside me
Modern Love walks on by
Modern Love gets me to the Church on Time
Church on Time terrifies me 
Church on Time makes me party
Church on Time puts my trust in God and Man 
God and Man no confessions
God and Man no religion
God and Man don't believe
in Modern Love


I could escape this feeling 
with my China girl
I feel a wreck 
without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating
loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing 

I'm a mess
without my little China girl 
Wake up mornings where's my little China girl
I hear her heart's beating 
loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down

I feel a-tragic 
like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my china girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swasticas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says : sh-sh-shhh


Let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway 
while color lights up your face
Let's sway 
sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance for fear 
your grace should fall
Let's dance for fear tonight is all

Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance put on your red shoes 
and dance the blues

Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight


Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life 
are gone
I look into my eyes

There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What could I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand

There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I do


Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - Ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures 
so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep

Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts, things like that
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet - It's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil 
breaking parole
Ricochet - Ricochet
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun,
they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places 
they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet 
it's not the end of the world

But when they get home, 
damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten


You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognize your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is sort of separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
(ah, ah, ah)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal worl
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

You've got a very heavy reputation
But no one knows about your low-life
I know a way
to find a situation 
And hold a candle 
to your high life disguise
You caught me kneeling 
at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just 
what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
(ah, ah, ah)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys


See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire 
With gasoline

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire 
with gasoline
putting out fire
with gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart 
that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made
can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru

You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
with gasoline
putting out fire with gasoline


I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

I duck and I sway - What's my line
Shoot at a full moon - What's my line
What's my line - Shake it baby

Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money

We're the kind of people 
who can shake it 
if we're feeling blue
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
Shake it baby


Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the holy land
Opening telegrams

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray 
all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide
the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things,
loving the alien)

And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail
