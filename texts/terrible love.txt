It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders It's a terrible love and I'm walking in It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders It's a terrible love and I'm walking in This quiet company This quiet company It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders It's a terrible love and I'm walking in It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders It's a terrible love and I'm walking in This quiet company This quiet company This quiet company  And I can't fall asleep Without a little help It takes a while to settle down My shivered bones Until the panic's out  It takes an ocean not to break It takes an ocean not to break It takes an ocean not to break It takes an ocean not to break Company This quiet company This quiet company  But I won't follow you Into the rabbit hole I said I would but then I saw Your shivered bones They didn't want me to  It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders It's a terrible love and I'm walking in It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders It's a terrible love and I'm walking in It takes an ocean not to break It takes an ocean not to break It takes an ocean not to break
