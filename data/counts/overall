this is	13382
and i	12163
going to	11381
and the	11238
to be	11092
to the	10786
on the	9687
is a	8207
that we	7879
you can	7588
in a	7583
i was	7491
at the	7353
to do	7184
we have	7183
if you	7126
the world	7002
is the	6980
want to	6950
and we	6443
it was	6385
we can	6355
a lot	5948
of a	5875
i think	5861
is that	5822
one of	5796
have to	5791
and then	5651
for the	5105
the same	4872
that the	4811
kind of	4734
from the	4724
as a	4698
have a	4684
with the	4678
you know	4608
and so	4594
that i	4556
it is	4516
the first	4512
lot of	4406
and they	4385
thank you	4312
and it	4280
there are	4280
all of	4263
all the	4204
we are	4070
a little	4017
was a	3908
and this	3835
you have	3781
its a	3741
to make	3711
so i	3706
about the	3694
look at	3690
out of	3683
and you	3662
in this	3658
which is	3653
to get	3641
and that	3605
need to	3595
able to	3565
that is	3542
the way	3386
when i	3377
with a	3362
by the	3336
of this	3307
the most	3306
what we	3304
and its	3298
is not	3256
that you	3185
if we	3169
of our	3168
for a	3166
i want	3163
a very	3100
i have	3064
of these	3010
into the	2987
to a	2985
some of	2850
so we	2834
when you	2817
i had	2798
its not	2793
i dont	2781
we need	2781
and a	2749
to have	2737
in fact	2732
you see	2732
there is	2731
but i	2721
they were	2718
of course	2716
that they	2682
the other	2679
and in	2670
on a	2630
can see	2627
that are	2592
and he	2588
to go	2587
part of	2574
a few	2564
to see	2548
that was	2516
they are	2470
and thats	2445
what i	2398
of us	2396
we were	2383
in our	2378
trying to	2367
in my	2346
of my	2337
when we	2332
think about	2324
of them	2286
theres a	2283
have been	2274
years ago	2242
but the	2241
was the	2214
and what	2210
we dont	2208
be a	2202
i can	2182
like this	2160
im going	2155
do you	2150
the time	2147
there was	2137
sort of	2113
the next	2110
are the	2099
people who	2080
would be	2059
how to	2059
he was	2046
can be	2044
i would	2040
to me	2038
of you	2037
of that	2034
and if	2030
percent of	2027
will be	2024
like a	2018
around the	1999
is to	1997
over the	1981
tell you	1971
so the	1964
i mean	1962
had to	1954
wanted to	1924
to take	1913
but it	1905
they have	1897
that it	1895
more than	1883
were going	1875
we do	1871
have the	1866
of people	1856
the brain	1852
us to	1849
the last	1841
back to	1839
we had	1812
we know	1800
do it	1786
like to	1785
little bit	1775
and when	1766
things that	1752
i am	1745
so what	1742
can do	1731
know that	1729
so that	1723
as the	1722
had a	1717
at a	1714
these are	1711
of those	1696
you are	1693
dont know	1692
but we	1692
talk about	1688
of all	1675
of it	1667
i know	1659
a new	1656
so this	1651
the right	1650
for example	1638
not just	1631
i said	1629
they can	1621
be able	1618
and to	1616
what you	1615
we could	1612
if i	1606
what is	1605
you want	1604
you to	1601
most of	1597
has been	1572
let me	1565
like the	1565
to say	1562
see the	1554
about it	1550
just a	1547
the only	1543
do that	1540
this was	1539
that were	1525
you dont	1521
into a	1512
go to	1507
the end	1505
are not	1487
the people	1484
i could	1480
each other	1478
you get	1475
who are	1471
way to	1467
is what	1457
do we	1454
to you	1454
try to	1451
about this	1449
the future	1446
for me	1441
that this	1440
to tell	1437
of their	1435
because i	1432
thats the	1431
up to	1429
right now	1425
think that	1417
in that	1415
something that	1414
not a	1412
to think	1410
but its	1408
to find	1402
it to	1395
used to	1394
do this	1390
we want	1389
from a	1387
is going	1386
and as	1385
in your	1377
you think	1375
the united	1372
so much	1371
on this	1370
dont have	1369
as we	1365
many of	1358
them to	1353
it and	1350
is an	1345
its the	1344
it in	1340
as well	1332
through the	1325
the best	1324
in their	1311
how do	1311
know what	1308
to know	1290
so you	1284
because of	1282
with this	1274
it has	1274
as you	1269
i thought	1268
we see	1266
is it	1264
of what	1255
be the	1250
talking about	1248
very much	1241
not only	1240
think of	1240
and im	1237
looking at	1233
because the	1232
would have	1224
because we	1223
to this	1221
me to	1220
is this	1220
to work	1214
he said	1214
united states	1214
a way	1213
that its	1213
as i	1209
and she	1207
make a	1201
up with	1199
kinds of	1196
but what	1195
what the	1190
to look	1188
to show	1187
of your	1185
you could	1178
what it	1177
when they	1177
what they	1176
to talk	1175
turns out	1171
to understand	1169
has a	1167
and there	1164
going on	1162
when the	1159
at this	1157
im not	1156
got to	1150
to give	1149
about a	1146
show you	1146
i didnt	1142
a couple	1140
take a	1139
the idea	1137
or a	1131
i just	1129
how we	1128
thats a	1123
because they	1119
thats what	1119
up in	1118
i got	1116
end of	1114
could be	1114
the whole	1114
you do	1111
the problem	1110
if youre	1105
you look	1104
their own	1103
it can	1100
it would	1099
for us	1087
thousands of	1087
get a	1083
because it	1082
you cant	1081
that there	1080
at all	1079
the middle	1078
to create	1077
by a	1075
here is	1070
to use	1069
you might	1067
the internet	1065
not the	1065
people are	1064
in order	1061
i did	1061
and all	1061
a good	1058
they dont	1057
you a	1055
to help	1052
much more	1049
might be	1048
where we	1048
we will	1040
the second	1038
then we	1036
the things	1035
people in	1034
instead of	1029
are going	1028
see that	1027
we think	1026
i started	1026
that in	1026
we all	1026
like that	1024
she was	1024
number of	1012
i do	1009
than the	1009
in which	1006
a big	1002
up and	1002
the human	1002
and more	1000
to my	999
and my	998
about how	997
i went	995
or the	993
to come	993
and how	991
to build	991
the more	982
that if	981
we did	980
what if	979
there were	979
we get	978
where the	978
do with	978
sense of	974
should be	974
a great	973
it doesnt	972
the one	971
so if	968
order to	968
the question	967
but they	965
a long	963
that would	962
way that	961
that he	960
the fact	958
the very	956
it turns	955
a bit	950
that can	949
our own	948
and one	946
were not	945
i wanted	942
the us	941
do is	933
we should	929
get to	928
are a	924
it will	924
at least	924
is just	920
but in	919
they had	915
and our	915
to us	912
to try	911
went to	911
thing that	909
has to	904
to change	904
got a	901
couple of	900
make it	900
give you	896
but you	894
and now	893
that a	892
with my	892
out to	890
believe that	889
are you	888
you will	888
new york	886
and were	886
out there	885
live in	883
my life	883
what do	877
first time	876
of life	873
this one	872
ability to	867
but if	867
you very	864
what happens	864
of an	863
fact that	859
lots of	855
you need	855
across the	849
get the	849
thats not	849
all these	849
ive been	848
to start	847
is one	845
based on	838
so many	838
is in	836
amount of	835
so it	833
say that	832
the past	831
every day	828
the reason	827
of how	826
a really	826
so its	826
people to	825
and not	825
so in	822
was not	819
and for	818
of his	818
you were	817
for you	816
of time	815
idea of	814
and these	812
was that	812
at that	812
you would	808
to our	806
if they	805
them and	804
how many	802
and theyre	802
how much	802
interested in	796
so they	795
to that	793
the new	793
way of	792
we would	792
not going	790
and theres	789
a year	787
change the	786
is really	786
front of	785
that has	784
out that	783
was in	782
just like	780
you go	780
bit of	778
these things	777
that people	776
i believe	775
decided to	773
that have	773
is very	772
come to	772
the story	771
not to	771
then i	770
we found	770
other people	770
started to	769
hard to	769
the rest	768
know how	766
things like	766
the answer	764
had been	764
hundreds of	763
me and	763
the earth	763
when it	762
and even	760
every single	760
on my	760
as it	759
figure out	758
to put	758
called the	757
of things	757
if the	756
in an	752
to learn	752
about what	749
can we	748
because its	748
is about	748
then you	747
a different	745
they do	744
looking for	743
but this	743
looked at	741
the planet	741
millions of	738
as an	738
out the	738
a small	736
in some	735
you that	735
looks like	734
on earth	734
the universe	733
up the	733
a single	732
thinking about	731
all over	731
what was	730
a whole	728
where you	727
have an	724
theres no	723
in front	722
away from	722
piece of	721
one thing	717
i love	714
do the	714
what were	714
where i	714
access to	711
may be	711
such a	710
to ask	710
was going	709
dont want	706
that will	703
is actually	703
we call	702
my own	700
time to	699
look like	696
the real	696
for this	694
the worlds	694
that when	693
take the	692
what are	691
i found	690
its very	689
to keep	688
see a	687
the top	686
did not	685
one is	683
its going	682
is so	678
the surface	677
about that	677
the thing	677
now we	676
i will	675
down to	675
weve been	674
terms of	673
its just	673
think we	672
youre going	671
then the	671
in terms	670
are in	669
no one	669
but also	667
with you	667
me that	666
them in	665
start to	665
and of	665
is no	665
means that	665
are all	664
few years	664
he had	662
are we	660
for that	659
see it	659
of years	658
we just	656
so when	656
years old	654
who is	654
in and	654
id like	654
weve got	653
of human	653
that means	651
who have	651
just the	651
a huge	648
rest of	648
can make	646
the great	646
think its	645
likely to	644
youve got	643
a world	643
and their	642
way we	640
a human	640
talk to	639
you and	639
and yet	639
so thats	639
with that	638
same time	637
thing is	637
world and	636
on it	635
to live	635
can you	635
had the	635
we started	635
you may	634
climate change	634
how the	633
what im	629
make the	629
all this	628
but then	628
a half	626
down the	626
enough to	626
im a	626
off the	625
on that	622
is how	621
one day	620
which we	618
between the	617
and at	616
many people	616
in other	615
is something	615
they would	615
a better	614
if it	614
to them	614
even though	612
we didnt	612
in one	610
we use	608
it could	608
on their	608
they could	606
to your	606
to play	604
that our	604
working on	604
after the	604
but that	604
for all	603
we go	603
a second	602
us and	602
do something	601
the data	600
we also	600
the water	598
but when	598
and on	598
and some	596
people that	593
can get	593
heres the	593
or not	592
something like	591
i knew	591
in his	591
the bottom	591
told me	591
do not	589
its really	589
its an	589
out and	587
create a	587
was an	586
the left	586
you just	585
we cant	583
go back	583
last year	582
i saw	582
the entire	582
with our	580
can actually	580
we got	579
than a	579
with me	579
put it	578
have no	578
come from	578
i get	577
it so	577
the kind	576
i really	576
and also	575
for them	575
people and	573
rather than	573
dont think	573
was to	570
i cant	570
people have	570
in all	569
because you	568
when he	568
but there	566
the country	566
found that	565
to share	565
you about	563
back in	562
all right	559
they will	559
here in	558
time and	558
years of	558
the word	557
most important	557
with it	557
it as	557
and just	557
that these	556
the power	556
thats why	555
were in	554
that all	554
for our	554
the size	554
want you	554
it means	553
supposed to	553
the day	552
theyre not	552
they want	551
on your	550
during the	550
a place	550
all that	549
the two	549
some people	549
it comes	548
which was	547
she said	546
a story	546
10 years	546
in these	544
are very	544
the beginning	544
to solve	543
that im	543
it with	543
the number	543
this kind	543
how it	542
group of	542
just as	541
every time	541
of its	540
and by	540
where they	539
it all	538
to move	537
would you	537
long time	537
time i	537
a problem	536
it wasnt	535
what happened	535
of being	534
form of	534
in it	534
on our	531
to figure	531
the ground	530
been a	529
that weve	528
do a	528
those who	528
as they	527
said that	526
can go	526
the point	526
its about	525
was just	525
bunch of	524
they said	524
size of	522
even more	521
such as	521
the moment	521
what would	520
more and	520
the case	520
you the	520
did you	520
does it	519
the ocean	519
and his	519
whats going	516
the sun	515
back and	515
that one	515
no longer	514
to it	514
can use	513
a computer	513
know the	512
a real	512
be in	512
tried to	511
have this	511
it looks	511
who was	510
does not	510
these people	510
and over	509
under the	509
to bring	508
to their	507
one that	507
there and	507
what does	506
came to	505
top of	505
not that	505
with their	504
from this	503
a sense	502
theyre going	502
how they	502
a time	501
i say	501
do i	501
were doing	501
the city	501
was very	501
deal with	500
it does	500
it on	500
so lets	498
youre not	498
that could	498
comes from	497
how can	496
i see	496
its like	496
just to	495
didnt have	495
of other	495
i hope	494
we look	492
your own	492
but not	491
in new	491
who were	490
to what	489
with these	488
now i	488
know about	487
the computer	487
that theres	487
middle of	487
as much	487
began to	486
the system	485
and said	485
same thing	484
didnt know	484
set of	484
i learned	484
a kind	483
is now	483
to become	483
use the	482
a day	482
why is	482
very different	481
see what	480
were all	480
i remember	480
was really	480
and here	479
so now	479
the year	479
the big	479
it for	478
now the	478
could have	478
not be	478
work with	477
that way	477
question is	477
its also	476
we really	476
an example	476
is my	475
realized that	475
and other	474
here we	474
parts of	473
and make	473
find a	473
so on	472
can take	472
idea that	471
out in	471
us that	471
it really	470
call it	470
world is	470
less than	469
as if	469
very important	469
were able	468
with an	468
and those	468
they didnt	468
we actually	468
we live	467
it up	467
of different	467
i realized	467
so im	466
these two	465
type of	465
what youre	465
could do	465
up a	465
the body	465
first of	465
20 years	464
a man	464
through a	464
life and	463
is also	463
but thats	462
made a	462
a group	462
the ability	462
comes to	461
they get	461
can tell	461
see in	460
it that	460
even if	459
each of	458
the biggest	458
in many	458
better than	458
this and	457
tell us	456
a question	456
which i	456
those are	454
that had	454
what about	453
in those	453
it into	453
this in	453
see this	452
high school	452
the robot	452
is because	451
it takes	451
i like	451
make sure	450
a certain	450
a bunch	450
we make	450
you take	449
age of	449
your brain	449
time in	449
what that	449
doing this	448
find out	448
the truth	448
its actually	447
the ones	447
problem is	447
human beings	447
you had	445
tend to	445
and with	444
doing it	444
get it	444
ive got	444
side of	444
on to	443
are so	443
am i	443
and every	443
not have	443
a million	441
this year	440
i feel	440
a number	439
a moment	439
needs to	439
over and	438
youre a	438
five years	437
was like	437
this thing	437
it a	436
that youre	435
to actually	434
build a	433
that and	433
picture of	433
were the	431
they need	431
that theyre	431
all kinds	430
that my	430
i decided	430
any of	430
years later	429
over time	428
end up	428
with all	427
work in	427
our lives	427
to an	426
a picture	426
can also	426
was so	426
the air	426
of information	425
care about	425
heres a	424
but theres	424
more likely	423
the back	423
come up	423
which are	422
it seems	422
see here	422
me a	421
come back	421
are actually	421
so for	420
when youre	420
a piece	420
think the	419
this case	419
thing to	419
tell me	418
they did	418
up on	418
the car	417
but for	417
that that	417
have you	417
but as	417
for it	417
need a	417
is called	417
and youre	416
too much	416
sorts of	416
this time	416
young people	416
for my	415
with them	415
sure that	415
you should	414
are more	414
to stop	414
my first	414
are some	414
power of	413
actually a	413
the morning	412
to all	412
it had	412
then they	412
in every	411
we put	410
to happen	410
together and	410
your life	410
what this	410
try and	410
history of	409
i call	409
is there	409
that time	409
which means	409
it makes	409
million people	408
its called	408
out how	408
and see	408
who had	408
we take	408
good at	407
it the	407
the process	406
we find	406
example of	406
we might	406
that to	406
the work	405
inside the	405
i asked	405
were a	404
at it	404
living in	404
feel like	404
just one	403
is more	403
how you	402
is all	402
much of	402
very good	402
and say	401
its been	400
down and	400
and ive	400
this idea	400
start with	399
the third	399
i came	399
i felt	399
is our	399
it out	399
its own	399
close to	399
that she	399
world that	398
a young	398
realize that	398
of me	397
so as	397
think this	397
was no	397
and look	397
will not	396
types of	396
can have	396
here and	396
easy to	396
for their	395
is why	395
a part	395
understand the	395
than that	394
had no	394
that makes	394
this way	394
it might	393
for instance	393
important to	393
must be	392
would like	391
very simple	390
but he	390
has the	389
and your	389
is where	389
about to	388
seems to	388
so how	387
did it	387
begin to	387
with your	386
work and	386
thought that	386
what a	386
so he	386
more of	385
and have	385
needed to	385
see how	384
would say	384
are doing	384
a woman	383
the room	383
the person	383
into this	382
why we	381
was actually	381
within the	381
help us	381
and get	381
like you	380
become a	379
people like	379
and people	379
are now	379
that as	378
or even	378
where it	378
the game	378
social media	378
being a	377
thing i	377
does that	377
and again	377
here to	377
from that	377
on and	376
that for	376
even the	375
for your	374
time that	374
same way	374
may have	374
of thousands	373
from my	373
came up	373
continue to	373
they go	373
before the	372
i need	372
i couldnt	372
and do	371
is we	371
the government	371
what to	371
in its	370
solar system	370
full of	370
half of	370
other words	370
they say	370
listen to	370
the global	369
wants to	369
will have	369
grew up	368
might have	368
but im	368
and maybe	368
one in	368
may not	367
youll see	367
you all	367
be more	367
lot more	367
why do	365
we saw	365
brain and	365
using the	365
and because	365
most people	365
to her	365
it just	365
level of	364
and women	364
only one	363
to really	363
the good	363
here are	362
focus on	362
does this	362
working with	360
you make	360
so far	360
understand that	359
a more	359
the key	359
go on	359
with us	359
you feel	359
in america	358
a car	358
talked about	358
to protect	358
all those	358
two years	358
i should	356
in there	356
she had	356
but a	356
about our	356
to believe	356
you find	355
my father	355
along the	355
got the	355
and weve	355
it but	355
not in	355
brain is	355
it also	354
work on	354
story of	354
to speak	354
having a	354
number one	354
it works	354
and many	353
on top	353
think thats	353
bit more	353
but to	352
men and	352
i look	352
of one	352
we went	352
have some	351
thats how	350
this room	350
a global	350
time we	350
of her	350
other things	349
think it	349
the average	349
from our	349
us a	349
we wanted	348
exactly what	348
to explain	348
i made	348
time you	347
it goes	347
so my	347
was born	347
next to	347
said to	346
but now	346
you in	346
my parents	346
to leave	346
to feel	346
idea is	346
my favorite	345
use it	345
again and	345
to deal	345
a child	345
because if	345
were trying	345
something else	345
the largest	345
he would	345
no matter	344
so were	344
was one	344
a while	344
took a	343
quite a	343
willing to	343
on in	343
the front	343
dont need	343
find the	343
something about	343
why i	342
this point	342
when a	342
its all	342
from one	342
it i	342
like me	341
look for	341
should have	341
and why	341
those things	341
of work	341
of data	341
if its	340
to these	340
the difference	340
a pretty	340
the technology	340
are also	340
came out	340
to develop	339
you put	339
things are	339
i took	338
every year	338
are just	338
well as	338
is like	337
now this	337
the moon	337
pretty much	336
not even	336
in any	336
world of	335
now in	335
of new	335
at some	335
to one	334
that doesnt	334
answer is	334
this has	334
we now	333
after a	333
none of	332
to people	332
a look	332
go into	331
that what	331
i guess	331
now is	331
be very	331
even in	331
and actually	330
ways to	330
how i	330
against the	330
are really	330
see if	330
point of	330
by this	330
believe in	330
an idea	329
no idea	329
in love	329
it took	329
now that	328
i also	328
you how	328
you say	328
to spend	328
because there	328
things we	327
to read	327
the age	327
any other	326
to write	326
because theyre	326
starting to	326
a high	326
be an	325
doesnt have	325
found a	325
do so	325
so here	325
of like	324
were just	324
be used	324
with one	324
he says	324
all know	324
of water	323
put a	323
out a	323
really important	323
the audience	323
that might	323
me in	323
the early	323
me i	322
a kid	322
i told	322
the street	322
what he	321
000 years	321
are still	321
do in	321
they all	321
the sound	321
time for	320
the old	320
have in	320
to study	320
a much	320
to turn	320
their lives	320
is still	319
to remember	319
im sure	319
future of	319
seem to	319
day and	319
are many	318
not really	318
were looking	318
can imagine	318
my mother	317
the red	317

that moment	249
what theyre	249
bit about	249
machine learning	249
why are	249
than you	249

from an	246
quality of	245
know why	245
turned out	245

this as	245
to end	245
tens of	245
that kind	244
have done	244
they know	244
interact with	244
theres an	244
a system	244

because in	240
as long	240
and go	240
call the	240
reason why	239
things to	239
of any	239
that most	239
just for	239
he could	239
the company	239

to survive	233
weve done	233
that same	233
risk of	233
tons of	233
it from	233
time of	233
lets look	233

range of	229
go from	229
whether its	229

youre in	229
not because	229
here on	229

they got	228
i grew	228
the long	228
a video	228
learned that	228
they make	228
to answer	228
put in	228
they found	228

my wife	227
through this	227
that so	227
went on	227
theyre all	227
majority of	227
not as	227
middle east	227
york city	227
the different	227
in addition	226
all in	226
only thing	226
our society	226
us is	226
theres nothing	226
that but	226
like in	226
how this	225
two weeks	225
the final	225
did this	225
but even	225
if that	225
it feels	225
a community	225
of view	225
that their	225
where are	224
can find	224
have more	224
life in	224
focused on	224
created a	224
i wrote	224
this talk	224
but my	223
our kids	223
that many	223
is probably	223
that those	223
the exact	223
in different	223
generation of	223
did we	223
and therefore	222
a series	222
name of	222
have not	222
ways of	222
together to	222
which you	222
be so	222
use this	222
the streets	222
few months	222
mean that	222
here i	222
is much	221
or maybe	221
100 percent	221
the highest	221
waiting for	221
just want	221
21st century	221
a particular	221
didnt want	221
weve had	221
and sometimes	221
a chance	220
really want	220
was doing	220
very hard	220
would never	220
as to	220
doing the	220
until the	220
from it	220
i work	220
my work	220
im here	220
human being	220
have these	219
of times	219
without a	219
problem of	219
and id	219
been working	219
learn to	219
think you	219
be done	219
would take	219
at an	219
much better	219
this very	219
who i	219
up here	218
someone who	218
we feel	218
face of	218
weve seen	218
some point	218
to his	218
that made	218
experience of	218
the machine	218
my brain	218
be doing	218
period of	218
the guy	218
very little	218
are two	218
what makes	218
to watch	218
it or	218
learn from	217
many different	217
i heard	217
the opportunity	217
time when	217
of doing	217
would go	217
take it	217
this isnt	217
the problems	217
still have	217
about them	217
it right	216
people of	216
found out	216
is possible	216
the table	216
is your	216
was at	216
here you	216
pick up	216
or you	216
when were	216
there to	215
that point	215
because when	215
fossil fuels	215
my job	215
dont do	215
feels like	215
what its	215
but because	215
never been	215
that with	215
we believe	215
money to	215
not very	215
two of	215

important thing	213
it its	213
technology and	213
you cannot	213
sound of	213
give a	213
to focus	213
get in	213
says that	213
the science	213
heard about	213
made the	213
and who	213
this would	213
they take	213
in science	213
bit like	213
had just	213
the blue	213
of some	212
as many	212
and very	212
about you	212
the basic	212
probably the	212
species of	212
means is	212
body and	212
we cannot	211
should we	211
my dad	211
into it	211
do things	211
takes a	211
go up	211
the present	211
life on	211
well be	211

that no	210
very long	210
to avoid	210
this whole	210
to send	210
thats because	210
not what	210

than it	210
image of	210
were actually	210
the speed	210
go down	210
half a	209
something called	209
the potential	209
an old	209
we knew	209
in them	209
wake up	209
the project	209
be like	209
wrong with	209
for every	209

or so	208
examples of	207
a black	207
our world	207
them the	207
make you	207
it becomes	207
that allows	207
search for	207
that thats	207
possible to	207
could see	206
youre doing	206
way and	206
case of	206
show that	206
a team	206
the actual	206
our bodies	206
it because	206
your mind	206
a major	206
but of	206
lead to	206
on what	206
map of	206
actually have	206
makes us	205
100 years	205
the original	205
the side	205
might not	205
to eat	205
he didnt	205
have access	205
one person	205
question that	205
who we	205
allow us	205
looked like	205
which has	205
at what	205

years in	204
no way	204
each one	204
four years	204
but with	204

a completely	179
them for	178
i live	178
we work	178
day i	178
them as	178
to where	178
things you	178
an image	178
an important	178
were also	178
very similar	178
a project	178
the floor	178
can now	178
went back	178
the challenge	178
be there	178
the high	178
food and	178
than i	178
of power	178

learn about	177
the economy	177
those two	177
a sort	177
you some	177
third of	176
the current	176
always been	176
theyre just	176
all our	176
this data	176
called it	176
a scientist	176
us who	176
could make	176
and use	176
line of	176
were very	176
a machine	176
in history	176
or less	175
and lets	175
eyes and	175
towards the	175
anything that	175
lets see	175
a school	175
there you	175
the children	175
the movie	175
technology that	175
this so	175
field of	175
other countries	175
them up	175
did was	175
by our	175
they may	175
told us	174
response to	174
imagine a	174
to test	174
you now	174
will never	174
around in	174
to join	174
ought to	174
are and	174
more importantly	174
a variety	174
a month	174
the solution	174
i were	174
i hear	174
and each	174
a tool	174
importance of	174
on me	174
they look	174
its that	174
you actually	174
20th century	174
theyve been	173
so forth	173
our time	173
seeing the	173
come together	173
this process	173
its time	173
had never	173
time is	173
you this	173
of something	173
at our	173
used for	173
how would	173
to describe	173
that of	173
more interesting	173
is good	173
view of	173
life that	172
an interesting	172
the better	172
the importance	172
to provide	172
the north	172
the animal	172
that night	172
for what	172
creating a	172
then he	172
lets say	172
of paper	172
this information	172
or your	172
there for	172
filled with	172
the language	171
thought it	171
depends on	171
video games	171
still a	171
get some	171
to love	171
things i	171
of stuff	171
in two	171
a point	171
of global	171
that happened	171
changes in	171
this really	170
that now	170
take that	170
in human	170
in nature	170
and ask	170
work of	170
these different	170
problems that	170
were still	170
they see	170
this the	170
a full	170
technology to	170
that because	170
our country	170
we built	170
or more	170
far more	170
you come	170
the music	169
why did	169
at how	169
play a	169
and two	169
he got	169
you must	169
a solution	169
you believe	169
me on	169
they took	169
only the	169
it sounds	169
thats an	169
because theres	169
that says	169
the context	169
people do	169
a word	169
whether or	169
goes to	169
are able	169
buy a	169
to discover	168
written by	168
these kinds	168
first place	168
our ability	168
give it	168
to win	168
like these	168
of food	168
so all	168
the local	168
fear of	168
about your	168
day of	168
that question	168
of dollars	168
better and	168
and find	168
the south	168
far away	168
now if	168
around with	168
that dont	168
i ask	168
im really	168
19th century	168
as this	167
who dont	167
were getting	167

make sense	167
working in	167
the situation	167
definition of	167
im doing	167
get them	167
development of	167
the numbers	167
if theres	167
even know	167
is at	167
our first	167
information about	167

the quality	167
closer to	167
combination of	167
having to	167

me show	166
real time	166
ever been	166
people say	166
we learned	166
learned to	166
now have	166
problem and	166
dark energy	166
seemed to	166
about five	166
and can	166
number two	166
maybe a	166
think there	166
one to	166
can only	166
theres some	166
30 percent	165
months ago	165
why the	165
of neurons	165
right there	165
more time	165
doing a	165
three months	165
that maybe	165
oh my	165
me give	165
pieces of	165

they even	127
a national	127
our body	127
from them	127
one i	126
a non	126

ive learned	126
is part	126
get back	126
up by	126
chance of	126

health care	126
by looking	126
feeling of	126
animals that	126
across a	126
before it	126
in public	126
you going	126
then theres	126
in most	126
is hard	126
by one	126
that sort	126
it got	126
an area	126
we bring	126
hope to	126
why you	126
playing with	126
trillion dollars	126
should do	126
in so	126
know and	126
i talk	126
us have	126
of many	126
life to	126
participate in	126
ideas and	126
and asked	126
get up	126
a bird	126
they went	126
before and	126
bring the	125
done a	125
around them	125
taking a	125
going into	125
is he	125
build the	125
we face	125
on with	125
five percent	125
perhaps the	125
be some	125
show the	125
scientists and	125
i left	125
places like	125
because that	125
use these	125
is right	125
better off	125
means we	125
the british	125
the animals	125
were you	125
around me	125
on for	125
were about	125
not at	125
the western	125
if thats	125
evolution of	125
data from	124
the cell	124
that an	124
is by	124
why this	124
this man	124
ive come	124
the majority	124
because these	124
not yet	124
and like	124
start by	124
world around	124
reasons why	124
to detect	124
might say	124
hard for	124
not good	124
really like	124
a specific	124
lets just	124
i try	124
dollars in	124
good enough	124
and new	124
very powerful	124
only to	124
science fiction	124
three things	124
in 2009	124
be thinking	124
of research	124
my talk	124
solve the	124
to notice	124
will tell	124
him in	124
we discovered	124
not something	124
of about	123
up all	123
rise to	123
of intelligence	123
why should	123
you understand	123
these robots	123
like my	123
turned into	123
apart from	123
have shown	123
different things	123
mind that	123
up this	123
the trees	123
to lose	123
our cities	123
happy to	123
figuring out	123
but most	123
is basically	123
for something	123
more complicated	123
today we	123
make me	123
next year	123
a unique	123
and human	123
but by	123
really understand	123
to cover	123
had not	123
forward to	123
through that	123
it allows	123
to reduce	123
im the	123
to 10	123
this issue	122
an individual	122
would get	122
people we	122
the open	122
they call	122
have ever	122
issue of	122
the normal	122
your car	122
under a	122
so is	122
longer than	122
we love	122
for being	122
in san	122
work at	122
my story	122
you live	122
a future	122
countries in	122
who said	122
seen before	122
the species	122
we realized	122
these ideas	122
coast of	122
plenty of	122
didnt really	122
can build	122
it very	122
like our	122
relationship with	122
to travel	122
humans and	122
in london	122
to accept	122
to generate	122
take out	122
ive seen	121
searching for	121
to new	121
to apply	121
it if	121
and science	121
such an	121
know we	121
so theyre	121
but just	121
whether you	121
how people	121
make these	121
children are	121
saw this	121
myself in	121
and things	121
the fish	121
the lhc	121
do know	121
things they	121
im very	121
to predict	121
are made	121
we share	121
a student	121
america and	121
theyre a	121
you imagine	121
turn to	121
later on	121
read the	121
data is	121
can all	121
order of	120
been on	120
make an	120
of humans	120
need the	120
to about	120
is pretty	120
to evolve	120
its no	120
where this	120
put that	120
just dont	120
in doing	120
a reality	120
are different	120
problems in	120
year we	120
i walked	120
say the	120
the previous	120
places that	120
africa and	120
had some	120
have so	120
and instead	120
the important	120
how well	120
this experiment	120
be better	120
actually do	120
known to	120
humans are	120
has made	120
play the	120
world so	120
will say	120
world today	120
this all	120
done it	120
actually be	120
or some	120
mother and	120
has done	120
first step	120
something very	120
took me	120
heard that	119
and something	119
the structure	119
we tend	119
dont care	119
you never	119
has never	119
world but	119
the ways	119
ever seen	119
a light	119
of everything	119
the secret	119
it through	119
happens is	119
that first	119
to encourage	119
comes up	119
were now	119
place for	119
of magnitude	119
this person	119
standing in	119
live on	119
in 2012	119
the tumor	119
never be	119
united nations	119
where theyre	119
machines that	119
the brains	119
the camera	119
these questions	119
place of	119
a culture	119
not saying	119
its easy	119
the classroom	119
give up	119
and has	119
well have	119
to ensure	119
get me	119
its probably	119

get older	84
out all	84
who live	84
take on	84
put out	84
theyre also	84
was thinking	83
a writer	83
a reason	83
up my	83
features of	83
scientists have	83
way around	83
many others	83
when one	83
and millions	83
it used	83
opened up	83
out my	83
youve ever	83
young woman	83
apply to	83
the planets	83
read a	83
sense to	83
together we	83
in prison	83
of earth	83
then when	83
as im	83
play it	83
doubt that	83
the culture	83
the differences	83
as important	83
meaning of	83
then she	83
or she	83
in iraq	83
a professional	83
is even	83
evolved to	83
bits of	83
make people	83
i bet	83
the machines	83
father was	83
could say	83
this device	83
of reasons	83
brain has	83
their kids	83
done that	83
the nation	83
to everyone	83
almost a	83
moment to	83

us on	83
a rock	83
dont go	83
about his	83
you be	83
knew what	83
out about	83
planets that	83
result is	83
fell in	83
didnt think	83
was what	83
always a	83
that into	83
a pattern	83
properties of	83
oil and	83
last one	83
population is	83
for coming	83
the benefits	83
disease and	83
so excited	83
while they	83
built up	82
system so	82
i realize	82
human and	82
youve heard	82
a career	82
factors that	82
the books	82
youd have	82
past few	82
point that	82
each time	82
to spread	82
see its	82

one of the	3156
this is a	2594
i want to	2378
im going to	2090
this is the	2005
you can see	1982
in the world	1883
going to be	1868
and this is	1829
we need to	1748
a little bit	1729
were going to	1702
be able to	1610
we have to	1548
you have to	1259
and i think	1199
you want to	1196
the united states	1183
some of the	1126
is going to	1098
look at the	1094
around the world	1083
part of the	1044
to be a	988
in order to	959
the end of	947
out of the	943
of the world	942
we want to	934
it turns out	925
when i was	892
that we can	883
so this is	878
that we have	878
are going to	854
this is what	852
i dont know	849
it was a	843
there is a	828
thank you very	824
percent of the	819
you very much	813
we have a	811
and i was	810
the fact that	805
the first time	795
and you can	792
there was a	783
a couple of	782
i wanted to	781
all of the	781
and if you	776
to tell you	774
of the most	769
in the middle	766
you look at	760
not going to	759
to be able	703
to do with	692
to talk about	687
in front of	680
and it was	679
this is not	674
to show you	670
in terms of	659
if you look	657
the rest of	644
how do we	641
to do that	639
to have a	635
we can do	631
youre going to	621
at the same	615
in the united	614
going to do	609
by the way	608
its going to	606
all of us	604
back to the	604
all of these	602
the same time	602
want to be	596
the things that	595
that you can	590
to do it	590
at the end	583
all over the	576
have to be	575
i was a	570
end of the	568
i have to	566
at the time	564
to look at	562
that we are	562
to think about	556
is that the	547
id like to	542
to do this	542
to be the	539
i think that	537
all the time	537
and then we	536
the kind of	535
is one of	534
i have a	531
and a half	529
and i said	527
and that is	523
i had to	519
this kind of	518
you have a	516
and we can	513
to go to	512
on the other	510
dont want to	509
is that we	507
to try to	504
to make a	501
and one of	500
if you want	498
the size of	496
to do is	495
and we have	495
for the first	494
we know that	491
of the things	491
most of the	490
and of course	488
the middle of	486
want you to	481
and in the	481
people who are	481
in a way	479
a few years	478
i think we	478
want to do	478
that this is	476
there is no	476
a kind of	476
to figure out	472
is not a	467
in the same	464
and so i	462
was going to	459
theyre going to	457
were able to	455
the way we	452
i dont think	449
one of these	442
and then i	440
how do you	439
the most important	438
have to do	437
a bunch of	436
and there are	434
i want you	433
and he said	432
you need to	431
lot of people	429
but if you	427
we have the	426
turns out that	425
is a very	424
it was the	424
going to have	423
i went to	423
the same thing	423
in the last	421
and in fact	420
all kinds of	420
i think its	420
one of them	418
this is an	418
more and more	417
what do you	417
dont have to	417
it would be	416
if you think	416
and when i	414
one of my	413
so you can	413
that i was	413
little bit of	409
we dont know	408
the world and	408
you think about	408
for us to	407
as you can	406
the people who	403
you can do	403
the idea of	402
need to be	402
the way that	401
you know what	400
all of this	400
and i want	399
many of you	398
think about it	397
of the brain	395
one of those	395
we had to	393
the ability to	392
we dont have	391
go to the	390
it is a	390
a long time	389
that there are	389
up in the	386
because of the	385
which is a	385
its not just	382
in this case	380
whats going on	378
all the way	378
first of all	373
so if you	372
to make it	371
in the morning	371
these are the	368
going to get	367
and then the	366
in the first	366
in the future	365
a part of	364
the number of	362
that if you	362
and if we	361
in other words	361
on the left	360
the same way	359
and so on	358
people in the	358
they want to	357
and i thought	357
can see the	356
and so we	356
a way to	354
in new york	353
i had a	353
going to show	351
what is the	351
to say that	350
to give you	349
think about the	349
some of you	347
if you dont	344
a sense of	343
but i think	341
and i have	341
theres a lot	341
were trying to	340
a lot more	339
when it comes	339
a piece of	339
to do something	337
and all of	336
as well as	336
which is the	335
more likely to	335
we look at	334
in the past	334
can see that	333
a number of	333
to deal with	332
of the people	332
if you can	330
if you have	330
it comes to	329
that was the	328
of thousands of	326
tell you that	326
the world is	326
over the world	326
we can see	326
but this is	325
and its not	322
if we could	321
and its a	321
give you a	321
know how to	319
want to talk	318
some of them	318
i was in	318
and i had	318
that is the	317
would like to	316
to get a	316
the power of	315
but it was	314
you dont have	313
it looks like	312
there are many	312
and then you	311
what you see	311
over and over	310
going to go	310
in this room	310
to do the	309
and thats what	308
the problem is	306
if we can	306
on the right	306
that it is	302
go back to	302
and it is	301
to see the	301
to get the	300
the age of	300
to create a	300
that would be	300
some of these	299
tell you about	299
we wanted to	299
the beginning of	298
out to be	298
rest of the	298
that i had	297
so i think	297
all of you	297
but its not	296
in the us	296
do you think	296
to take a	295
all sorts of	295
on top of	295
to make the	295
is not the	294
a group of	294
to talk to	293
that it was	293
the future of	293
the first thing	293
there was no	292
look at this	290
we live in	290
and i can	289
and that was	289
been able to	289
and when you	289
i think the	289
it can be	289
of the worlds	288
few years ago	288
parts of the	288
come up with	284
and the reason	282
going to take	282
over the last	282
this is how	282
what i want	281
that there is	281
this was a	280
it is the	280
at this point	280
i know that	280
the other side	279
i think this	279
and i dont	279
if you were	279
looking at the	279
the amount of	279
a way that	278
i decided to	277
you can imagine	277
the answer is	276
it in the	276
able to do	276
and they are	275
the question is	275
the surface of	275
what we do	274
in the next	274
the other hand	274
that in the	274
want to know	274
and i would	274
up with a	274
in the brain	273
and then they	272
i dont want	272
there are a	272
to be in	271
its a very	271
live in a	270
has to be	270
and he was	270
a matter of	269
to each other	268
can do it	268
all of our	268
we think about	268
to make sure	267
of the time	266
you see the	266
many of the	265
kind of a	265
the first one	265
and thats the	264
men and women	264
and im going	263
in a very	262
need to do	261
so we can	261
and we were	260
up to the	259
the history of	259
just a few	258
and you know	258
is the most	257
so let me	255
and at the	255
came up with	255
as a result	254
what it is	254
and what we	254
on the planet	254
would be a	254
of all the	254
things that we	254
as soon as	253
a picture of	253
it will be	253
how can we	253
i dont have	252
was able to	252
being able to	251
this was the	251
dont know what	251
is something that	251
we are not	250
that i think	250
that we need	249
have a lot	249
this is my	249
as much as	248
every one of	248
most of us	247
make sure that	247
they have a	246
and all the	246
so we have	246
i think thats	245
that they were	245
for me to	243
there are no	243
what if we	243
of the first	243
they have to	243
to try and	242
figure out how	242
i believe that	241
is what we	241
to change the	241
by the time	241
of people who	240
a bit of	239
little bit more	238
i started to	238
going to talk	237
and she said	237
of the human	237
that kind of	237
and theres a	237
its not a	237
for all of	237
it could be	236
youve got to	236
i would like	236
in a world	235
is that it	235
and they were	234
that we dont	234
we had a	234
me tell you	233
let me tell	233
to get to	233
and you have	232
is not just	232
many of us	232
going to make	232
a lot about	232
used to be	231
a look at	231
of my life	231
side of the	231
want to tell	231
to have to	230
that you have	230
this is one	230
to build a	229
this is where	228
and so the	228
so that we	228
to find out	228
new york city	227
all of those	227
in the end	227
the idea that	227
what to do	227
as long as	226
that we could	226
the only thing	226
i was going	225
kind of like	224
supposed to be	224
all of a	224
at a time	224
going to happen	223
of a sudden	223
we can use	223
was one of	222
can look at	222
i realized that	222
and i know	222
away from the	222
of them are	222
we all know	221
in my life	221
if you are	221
take a look	221
middle of the	221
what we call	221
the course of	220
for the last	220
thank you for	220
it has to	220
going to see	220
of all of	220
i grew up	219
and when we	219
and we need	219
can tell you	218
for a long	218
do you want	218
going to tell	218
were talking about	217
is in the	217
so what we	217
that they can	217
things that are	217
but in the	217
weve got to	216
i used to	216
with each other	216
is it that	216
it to the	215
what do we	215
the name of	214
a series of	214
part of a	214
they need to	213
at some point	213
little bit about	213
it in a	213
you see here	213
in the way	212
talk about the	212
this is just	212
want to show	212
out of a	212
was the first	211
trying to do	211
out how to	211
that i have	211
you get a	211
and some of	210
which is that	210
you can get	210
that they are	210
its kind of	209
think this is	209
i like to	209
there will be	209
the world that	208
lot of time	208
the solar system	208
had to be	208
to go back	208
to understand the	208
the story of	208
out in the	207
of the united	207
that there was	207
but there are	207
the middle east	207
and by the	207
there are some	207
we can make	206
to think of	206
we were able	206
what happens when	206
and so what	206
because i was	205
i think it	205
people who have	205
lets look at	205
and we are	204
and a lot	204
i was the	204
and as a	204
do you know	203
but it is	203
when you look	203
thousands of years	203
way that we	203
that i could	203
thats going to	203
here in the	203
i didnt know	202
talk to you	202
of what we	202
and this was	202
and there was	202
that we were	202
and what i	201
that you see	201
dont have a	201
allows us to	201
the center of	201
the only way	201
would have been	200
thing is that	200
thank you so	200
have access to	199
the way to	199
and the other	199
the face of	199
more than a	199
at that time	199
it is not	198
that is not	198
are we going	198
and on the	198
want to get	197
that all of	197
top of the	197
want to go	197
in the room	197
that can be	196
share with you	196
exactly the same	196
learn how to	196
if youre a	196
i can tell	196
and i got	195
on this planet	195
all of that	195
based on the	195
we should be	194
the difference between	194
you know that	194
and they have	194
get to the	194
of the earth	194
want to make	194
a world where	194
going on in	193
was in the	193
that we had	193
at the top	193
a little more	193
each other and	193
that was a	193
a way of	193
what we did	192
of these things	192
it as a	192
going to change	192
that we do	192
to the next	191
is just a	191
we can actually	191
what kind of	190
and you see	190
you thank you	190
so if we	190
if you go	190
is kind of	190
lot of the	190
allow us to	189
the ones that	188
the top of	188
how to do	188
it has a	188
this sort of	188
you have the	188
down to the	188
that they have	188
you see a	188
we going to	187
how many of	187
you go to	187
want to see	187
had to do	187
what we need	187
it is that	187
of the universe	187
the back of	186
what we found	186
it on the	186
at the beginning	185
what is it	185
what we can	185
one of our	185
have to have	185
the cost of	185
and it will	184
to do a	184
on the ground	183
that he was	183
you so much	183
was a very	183
the bottom of	183
dont know how	183
in which we	182
that i would	182
in the universe	182
to do so	182
to be more	182
tens of thousands	182
i think i	182
thats what we	182
the sound of	182
to find a	181
but at the	181
that when you	181
to focus on	181
you can go	181
so i was	181
talking about the	181
the idea is	180
think of it	180
to the world	180
you might be	180
told me that	179
for the next	179
wanted to do	179
really want to	179
dont know if	179
but i was	179
going to give	179
bit of a	179
that is a	178
to work with	178
look at that	178
back in the	178
and thats why	178
can do this	178
and it has	178
i would say	178
a few months	178
and in a	177
see in the	177
world war ii	177
something like this	177
i would have	177
all of them	176
in the early	176
front of the	176
some kind of	176
couple of years	176
many of them	175
the 21st century	175
a sort of	175
this is all	175
so im going	175
some sort of	175
the world of	175
000 years ago	175
how we can	174
and over again	174
looked at the	174
what are the	174
on the surface	174
we decided to	174
be in the	174
an example of	174
and so forth	173
and the way	173
do we do	173
would have to	173
to live in	173
went to the	173
as it is	173
for a while	173
of the day	173
and as you	172
a variety of	172
were in the	172
this is something	172
to see what	172
when you have	172
you dont know	172
that if we	172
and thats a	172
and i started	172
have to go	172
to share with	171
at the bottom	171
to think that	171
why do we	171
just going to	170
and look at	170
its not that	170
needs to be	170
it was just	170
why is it	170
what we have	170
this is really	170
those of you	169
and these are	169
of the other	169
if you take	169
the good news	168
has to do	168
whether or not	168
again and again	168
these kinds of	168
if you could	168
is the first	168
i look at	168
of the same	167
they dont have	167
i need to	167
just want to	167
a very simple	167
10 years ago	167
to me and	167
size of the	166
the real world	166
is that its	166
he was a	166
is that this	166
and we had	166
and for the	166
but thats not	166
let me show	166
on the internet	166
sort of a	165
but of course	165
to find the	165
the world in	165
the first place	165
we do that	165
you may have	165
that i can	165
at the moment	164
let me give	164
the speed of	164
as far as	164
our ability to	164
the lives of	164
how to make	164
and try to	164
so the question	164
a story about	164
and they can	164
i was born	164
and i went	164
that means that	164
the other thing	164
get out of	163
like this one	163
we are going	163
but its also	163
in the process	163
of this is	162
it is to	162
that theres a	162
each of these	162
thank you thank	162
what i call	162
surface of the	162
but what if	162
so how do	162
those are the	162
i got a	161
are able to	161
the one that	161
the world to	161
was a little	161
it was not	161
we can look	161
is what i	161
here is a	161
look at it	161
the people in	161
and they said	160
idea is that	160
and the answer	160
think about how	160
point of view	160
figure out what	160
the same as	160
seems to be	160
me show you	160
so i want	160
we are the	160
that we see	160
im not going	160
them in the	159
here is the	159
because it was	159
and it turns	159
and she was	159
we have an	159
the heart of	159
in the back	159
i was like	159
if we want	159
that we will	158
have you ever	158
what im going	158
not just the	158
hundreds of thousands	158
thats what i	158
you can have	158
what were doing	158
all the other	158
me give you	157
are in the	157
dont need to	157
of the planet	157
you a little	157
i just want	157
to understand how	157
the people that	157
the most powerful	157
is that you	157
you get the	157
as part of	157
and as we	157
the brain and	157
and if i	157
to take the	157
and then it	157
is a little	157
we talk about	156
to come up	156
can do that	156
the truth is	156
of the future	156
give you an	156
grew up in	156
along the way	155
millions of people	155
part of our	155
in real time	155
we need a	155
in my lab	155
thousands of people	155
the importance of	155
we get to	154
the reason why	154
and we know	154
be part of	154
that have been	154
to see if	154
united states and	154
im talking about	154
for a moment	154
where we are	154
to know that	153
but we have	153
you think of	153
do you do	153
we all have	153
but you can	153
this is that	153
what that means	153
in one of	153
to see that	152
you can take	152
in love with	152
going to start	152
tell you a	151
so when you	151
the new york	151
to realize that	151
come back to	151
the university of	151
by the end	151
to believe that	151
and i am	150
it into a	150
some of us	150
trying to figure	150
more or less	150
look at a	150
but i dont	150
a set of	150
wanted to be	150
about how we	150
so you have	150
and as i	150
were looking for	150
half of the	150
i looked at	149
the thing that	149
trying to get	149
the time i	149
the brain is	149
as i was	149
what it means	149
we dont want	149
part of this	149
now this is	149
and were going	149
want to have	148
and i just	148
up on the	148
i am a	148
the kinds of	148
have to make	148
but we dont	148
first time in	148
in all of	148
and we dont	148
to be an	147
in the right	147
we found that	147
this is going	147
over the next	147
so in the	147
is the only	147
but there is	147
of millions of	147
to me that	147
the quality of	147
if we were	147
you and i	147
of the story	147
this idea of	147
to the right	147
didnt want to	146
but i want	146
get rid of	146
think of the	146
of you who	146
about the future	146
so i went	146
had no idea	146
the process of	146
one of us	146
percent of our	146
there are two	145
and there is	145
have no idea	145
see that the	145
change the way	145
up in a	145
the opportunity to	145
why dont we	145
to help us	145
in this country	145
so we need	144
this is why	144
if we dont	144
different kinds of	144
there have been	144
which means that	144
that we know	144
think about this	144
need to know	144
of you are	144
million years ago	144
we are all	143
the more i	143
is a really	143
the spinal cord	143
the next generation	143
of us are	142
think that the	142
and in this	142
of the internet	142
is that when	142
can see here	142
is a lot	142
and i didnt	142
to be very	142
go to a	142
that you are	142
going to try	142
is actually a	141
you an example	141
how it works	141
to you about	141
of us who	141
because if you	141
do we have	141
its not the	141
we have in	141
dont have the	141
much of the	141
you can actually	141
i can do	141
the nature of	141
and you get	141
said to me	140
most of them	140
to see how	140
i began to	140
we can get	140
of you have	140
take care of	140
the 20th century	140
it feels like	140
it was an	140
one thing that	140
what i do	140
if you do	140
would be the	139
ill tell you	139
because we have	139
on the screen	139
we can also	139
so for example	139
can we do	139
able to make	139
we will be	139
and the first	139
out of it	138
where you can	138
we try to	138
but we can	138
and the same	138
of the great	138
to make this	138
lot of things	138
whats going to	137
it should be	137
so what i	137
trying to understand	137
thing to do	137
to have the	137
what does that	137
every time i	137
when you get	137
is the same	137
think about what	137
back into the	137
of the body	137
that its not	137
what i did	137
do a lot	137
not the only	136
wanted to know	136
he had a	136
we could do	136
which is why	136
heres the thing	136
be one of	136
the human body	136
can be used	136
all around the	136
do the same	136
because this is	136
we used to	136
but in fact	135
now we have	135
you had to	135
up with the	135
every single day	135
to do in	135
things that i	135
that we should	135
i am not	135
and what they	135
there are other	135
in the air	135
the last few	135
we have this	135
in the lab	135
make a difference	134
of the way	134
we are in	134
for the future	134
and so this	134
have a very	134
change the world	134
in the face	134
to make that	134
we have no	133
and its the	133
when they were	133
lets take a	133
kinds of things	133
what are you	133
what we want	133
that we cant	133
to know what	133
years from now	133
and he says	133
but what i	133
will be a	133
the thing is	133
when i got	133
i think about	133
what i was	133
can be a	133
of things that	133
the human brain	133
on in the	133
to see a	132
it was very	132
oh my god	132
you can make	132
so i started	132
i think there	132
where we have	132
do is to	132
are a lot	132
you know how	132
people who were	132
was going on	132
that we all	132
its hard to	132
seem to be	132
a very important	131
with all the	131
its just a	131
in ways that	131
for the past	131
talk about it	131
it turned out	131
even if you	131
youre looking at	131
90 percent of	131
not just a	131
they can be	131
that most of	131
the case of	131
it means that	131
because we are	131
i think you	131
how many people	131
that has been	131
why is that	131
have the ability	131
got to be	131
the right to	131
are trying to	131
i had no	131
so they can	131
is not an	131
to the other	131
this is our	131
you see that	131
i think is	130
no matter how	130
the way you	130
the development of	130
we can take	130
able to see	130
a very long	130
something that is	130
the best way	129
will be able	129
want to share	129
the form of	129
it was really	129
here is that	129
on the one	129
of our lives	129
about how to	129
in the water	129
in the audience	129
in a different	129
the 19th century	129
in their own	129
im trying to	129
i know what	128
to understand that	128
coming out of	128
and what you	128
of their own	128
problem is that	128
a few of	128
in your life	128
that is that	128
you see in	128
we also have	128
two and a	128
the use of	128
for a very	128
i was just	128
we looked at	128
so many of	128
is that they	128
and so they	127
if you had	127
do with the	127
so its a	127
when you think	127
he told me	127
a good thing	127
a chance to	127
but heres the	127
but you know	127
each and every	127
ladies and gentlemen	127
lot of money	127
very hard to	127
have to say	127
you are a	127
i hope that	127
and if youre	127
for them to	127
i got to	127
in the uk	127
thing that i	127
beginning of the	126
of those things	126
of our own	126
a long way	126
but we are	126
turned out to	126
a result of	126
at that point	126
the next day	126
i can see	126
across the world	126
so the first	126
put it in	126
in addition to	125
show you a	125
go out and	125
up and down	125
want to take	125
it might be	125
what about the	125
going to use	125
of the reasons	125
in a few	125
no matter what	125
they are the	125
80 percent of	125
the developing world	125
most of you	125
looks like a	125
the answer to	125
a few weeks	125
the sense of	124
in the year	124
what im saying	124
but theres a	124
have the same	124
size of a	124
these are all	124
but when you	124
but if we	124
i thought i	124
in the country	124
one of you	124
and then he	124
to work on	124
can change the	124
people on the	124
so these are	124
of you may	124
because there are	124
believe that the	124
something like that	123
us to do	123
what we see	123
were looking at	123
some of those	123
if i had	123
its the same	123
group of people	123
tell you what	123
of the year	123
doesnt have to	123
they wanted to	123
that some of	123
what does this	122
to the point	122
is a great	122
a lot to	122
and in that	122
what i mean	122
but when i	122
who we are	122
on their own	122
can think of	122
this is actually	122
we see the	122
the context of	122
i had the	122
more than just	121
we can have	121
what was going	121
now we can	121
you dont need	121
that they had	121
i thought that	121
so it was	121
of people in	121
nothing to do	121
the head of	121
that the world	121
but we also	120
know that the	120
was trying to	120
and when they	120
out of this	120
it doesnt have	120
really hard to	120
we can go	120
means is that	120
are the most	120
and i say	120
when you hear	120
in this way	120
it was like	120
from each other	120
we do not	119
that i dont	119
is not that	119
the experience of	119
i found myself	119
for a second	119
i was doing	119
to come back	119
to look for	119
you take a	119
looking for a	119
what are we	119
center of the	119
turns out to	119
you would have	119
what they do	119
you might think	119
when i first	118
of climate change	118
and i realized	118
is part of	118
a very different	118
in the field	118
you do it	118
any kind of	118
we have been	118
and i could	118
with the same	118
there in the	118
is how we	118
so that they	118
is that if	118
even in the	118
in many ways	118
so when i	118
the point is	118
are you going	118
the result of	118
and it doesnt	118
for those of	118
that if i	118
has been a	118
it or not	117
percent of all	117
we tend to	117
them in a	117
of years ago	117
of the population	117
and not just	117
we dont need	117
leave you with	117
what you can	117
we think of	117
the world around	117
what i think	117
what we are	117
and i remember	117
about the world	117
most important thing	117
terms of the	117
i would be	117
of my favorite	117
to do what	116
to get out	116
its a little	116
what would you	116
were in a	116
come out of	116
something that we	116
that sort of	116
i could have	116
it seems to	116
and every one	116
and thats not	116
we started to	116
are the ones	116
so that the	116
to do and	116
so thats what	116
but its a	116
tell you the	116
of how we	116
went back to	116
i told you	116
we didnt have	116
them to be	116
and lots of	116
front of me	116
so its not	115
could be a	115
and i believe	115
you can find	115
ways that we	115
show you the	115
in our own	115
this this is	115
back and forth	115
likely to be	115
and so it	115
tell you how	115
but i have	115
go into the	115
show you how	114
here we have	114
the very first	114
so i have	114
a whole lot	114
like this and	114
they had to	114
and we found	114
may not be	114
the next few	114
the work of	114
that one of	114
at the age	114
im not sure	114
of us have	114
is that i	114
the problem of	114
the whole world	114
is trying to	114
can do is	114
the internet and	114
then we have	114
the one hand	114
look at what	113
then you can	113
the reason is	113
i was not	113
came out of	113
new york times	113
the first is	113
the level of	113
at the university	113
we do it	113
to remember that	113
so i thought	113
to come to	113
know what it	113
i had been	113
have to get	113
and im not	113
go ahead and	113
want to say	112
thought it was	112
going to the	112
and because of	112
and i wanted	112
fact that we	112
what we know	112
is that there	112
going to work	112
and the more	112
to be doing	112
you going to	112
to know about	112
we didnt know	112
so we had	112
i have been	112
we think that	112
is on the	112
and they had	112
ive got to	111
so what is	111
interested in the	111
most of our	111
can make a	111
need to think	111
the world we	111
something that i	111
we do this	111
if i was	111
not supposed to	111
50 percent of	111
comes from the	111
if you will	111
its called the	110
very long time	110
in the case	110
the united nations	110
at the very	110
i did not	110
here on earth	110
its like a	110
youre talking about	110
to ask you	110
you can be	110
and that means	110
that you cant	110
time in the	110
sense of the	110
and i saw	110
the equivalent of	110
and they will	110
sorts of things	110
we see that	109
and a little	109
what it was	109
that could be	109
in some cases	109
in the context	109
what would happen	109
and so you	109
that we use	109
to go through	109
little bit like	109
while i was	109
when you see	109
out into the	109
if we are	109
they had a	109
but there was	109
a bit more	109
by looking at	109
to become a	109
in the west	109
spend a lot	109
each one of	109
does that mean	108
what do i	108
those of us	108
they were able	108
to get it	108
if youre not	108
a very good	108
think we can	108
to be one	108
so we started	108
in all the	108
to do to	108
people around the	108
and how they	108
which is to	108
able to get	108
when you do	108
it to be	108
that were going	108
in the form	108
more than that	108
is the best	108
of them is	108
and when the	108
than any other	108
of a human	108
a few days	108
as a matter	108
trying to find	108
and most of	108
you may be	108
because they are	108
a quarter of	107
to do anything	107
ill show you	107
we know about	107
if we look	107
the whole thing	107
of them and	107
like to think	107
so much more	107
other side of	107
they are not	107
it has been	107
for people to	107
im here to	107
i tried to	107
about this is	107
and let me	107
that will be	107
place in the	107
think that we	107
when i started	107
a third of	107
to use the	107
a place where	107
that had been	107
the way the	107
never going to	106
you think that	106
the exact same	106
but what we	106
some of my	106
that i want	106
out on the	106
think its a	106
we can be	106
want to give	106
a time when	106
but when we	106
when we look	106
because it is	106
the world today	106
i was so	106
and the only	106
to all of	105
in such a	105
can see this	105
its one of	105
just a little	105
and its really	105
as a child	105
you get to	105
way to the	105
put them in	105
and i asked	105
bottom of the	105
over the years	105
is going on	105
to be really	105
what happens to	105
to see it	105
so when we	105
what you do	105
were not going	105
when we think	105
been working on	105
if it was	105
its a big	105
percent of their	105
to create the	104
period of time	104
in the dark	104
access to the	104
need to have	104
the time of	104
to do was	104
i knew that	104
or at least	104
many of these	104
we can create	104
might be able	104
you to do	104
the other one	104
this type of	104
think we need	104
on the way	104
in the history	104
the front of	104
lets start with	104
there are more	104
then you have	104
really good at	104
you do that	104
a bit like	104
the way i	104
so i decided	104
if you know	104
who they are	103
that it can	103
is not only	103
for the rest	103
we call it	103
and you dont	103
and the most	103
be a little	103
you dont want	103
more than one	103
and we think	103
of one of	103
i didnt have	103
we are now	103
and here is	103
the universe is	103
the chance to	103
to be part	103
that means is	103
first time that	103
and a few	103
we can change	103
was born in	103
so i had	103
is all about	103
different types of	103
have to take	103
we went to	102
we need more	102
and then a	102
to understand what	102
thats exactly what	102
i had this	102
to use a	102
map of the	102
millions of years	102
i tell you	102
to learn how	102
youve got a	102
that is what	102
that its a	102
of them were	102
is a picture	102
to get into	102
if there was	102
the reality is	102
of it as	102
so theres a	102
a different way	102
is what the	101
that weve been	101
what were going	101
four in the	101
every time you	101
and i hope	101
and the second	101
first one is	101
a hundred years	101
things like that	101
over the course	101
and heres the	101
raise your hand	101
the basis of	101
and how we	101
are not the	101
that they could	101
he wanted to	100
need to go	100
they have the	100
but it also	100
it doesnt matter	100
and i did	100
we now have	100
because they were	100
up at the	100
we see it	100
that this was	100
back to that	100
can get a	100
but it turns	100
20 years ago	100
that you dont	100
i knew i	100
for most of	100
what it looks	100
the majority of	100
not only that	100
going to need	100
i think of	100
all these things	100
because its a	100
in which the	100
this in the	99
of the ocean	99
over the past	99
that i am	99
and we could	99
going to look	99
and i found	99
it into the	99
kind of thing	99
going to say	99
you can also	99
can see how	99
to make them	99
tend to be	99
this is about	99
the state of	99
and many of	99
can see it	99
there are three	99
the problem with	99
do something about	99
on the floor	99
is to be	99
and i will	99
what can we	99
the things we	99
what does it	99
so thats the	99
that are not	99
is not going	99
to be here	98
to start with	98
set out to	98
can have a	98
and the world	98
the other way	98
have to look	98
so that was	98
do you have	98
i learned that	98
i was able	98
thing that we	98
the new yorker	98
what they were	98
this as a	98
out of their	98
to know how	98
of the problem	98
that might be	98
what theyre doing	98
the key to	98
thinking about the	98
to go on	98
just like the	98
so i said	98
you see this	98
friend of mine	98
in the ocean	98
to go out	98
we can all	97
that people who	97
the edge of	97
they will be	97
with a lot	97
how would you	97
that you could	97
were interested in	97
that i didnt	97
so what do	97
if i could	97
the way they	97
we dont really	97
to recognize that	97
much more than	97
the only one	97
that we would	97
the role of	97
i think theres	97
to worry about	97
will tell you	97
the sort of	97
and thats how	97
you will see	97
and out of	97
this means that	97
these things are	97
you do this	97
the risk of	97
and the idea	97
but i can	97
a human being	96
is based on	96
all the things	96
come to the	96
as we know	96
think we have	96
of the biggest	96
and trying to	96
you can look	96
me to the	96
to invest in	96
good news is	96
end of this	96
not just about	96
i was really	96
like to do	96
close to the	96
when he was	96
where we can	96
what we were	96
what happens is	96
out of my	96
not talking about	96
decided to do	96
as i said	96
have been a	96
means that we	96
the second thing	96
and now we	95
its important to	95
you to think	95
that it would	95
in this world	95
the effects of	95
i was there	95
to use it	95
i was looking	95
it is in	95
the relationship between	95
so if i	95
dollars a year	95
and they say	95
the concept of	95
to do things	95
put it on	95
do you see	95
happens to be	95
that we want	95
should be able	95
focus on the	95
this is also	95
look at all	95
so we were	95
find a way	95
how do i	95
to the top	95
know what the	95
work in the	94
i have no	94
i get to	94
in a lot	94
there is an	94
you see is	94
do it in	94
to work in	94
out to the	94
lot of work	94
look at these	94
it was about	94
country in the	94
to the surface	94
at me and	94
you in the	94
but one of	94
might be a	94
but they are	94
youre trying to	94
that many of	94
didnt know what	94
to one of	94
our solar system	94
in the city	94
any of the	94
best way to	94
here we are	94
happening in the	94
similar to the	94
a whole new	93
there would be	93
is able to	93
to all the	93
its actually a	93
the way it	93
sort of like	93
to give a	93
more of a	93
because i think	93
will not be	93
you can think	93
in some way	93
only way to	93
here we see	93
im not a	93
to listen to	93
and they would	93
the city of	93
there is something	93
and what it	93
allowed us to	93
when you go	93
weve got a	93
i came to	93
back to my	93
ive got a	92
10 percent of	92
ill give you	92
the world are	92
i try to	92
for many years	92
they can do	92
part of my	92
in the real	92
what is this	92
those who are	92
of that is	92
it would have	92
that when we	92
people have been	92
in a sense	92
same way that	92
working on this	92
we might be	92
up with this	92
that a lot	92
20 percent of	92
this has been	92
the european union	92
have all the	92
part of that	92
start with the	92
years ago and	92
when i went	92
as well and	92
and the thing	92
thats not the	92
for a few	92
it needs to	92
in san francisco	92
of it is	92
and we see	91
for you to	91
not in the	91
and in my	91
so i can	91
and we will	91
the earth is	91
and there were	91
you are not	91
for more than	91
we can now	91
we were going	91
you try to	91
years old and	91
something that you	91
way to do	91
we call the	91
i thought about	91
because of this	91
me that i	91
the hands of	91
that people are	91
also going to	91
and have a	91
to tell us	91
going to put	91
us to be	91
that look like	91
to go into	90
so that you	90
if were going	90
is much more	90
and think about	90
more like a	90
on the bottom	90
right now and	90
the point of	90
end up with	90
i was working	90
a map of	90
we are doing	90
out of our	90
no idea what	90
learning how to	90
went to a	90
it really is	90
so one of	90
this is in	90
of the last	90
the time and	90
look at how	90
not just for	90
ive come to	90
version of the	90
i love the	89
if we do	89
and then there	89
and its very	89
so in a	89
are on the	89
do with this	89
we know it	89
to the united	89
will be the	89
most of my	89
on the top	89
there are people	89
happened in the	89
and the question	89
at the right	89
the higgs boson	89
we do is	89
as opposed to	89
im not saying	89
why are we	89
here are some	89
i went back	89
this would be	89
and thats because	89
in the new	89
years ago i	89
come from the	89
of my own	89
me and my	88
have to think	88
part of their	88
if they were	88
show you what	88
it takes a	88
and they do	88
that you would	88
only thing that	88
when you were	88
the us and	88
had to go	88
hundreds of millions	88
and i were	88
in our society	88
there is one	88
they dont know	88
in human history	88
its not going	88
it means to	88
was just a	88
into the world	88
to leave you	88
the side of	88
a world that	88
with a little	88
have to ask	88
a very small	88
amount of time	88
what id like	88
of the water	88
is what happens	88
but we need	88
what was the	88
my name is	88
i made a	88
and it would	88
i was very	88
a new way	88
of what i	88
its not about	88
you cant do	88
and we did	88
the first step	87
i could do	87
things that you	87
how the brain	87
is what you	87
on the same	87
going to find	87
going to ask	87
because they have	87
to tell the	87
where i was	87
on the front	87
idea of the	87
to be that	87
am i going	87
you can just	87
matter of fact	87
on to the	87
have in common	87
it seems like	87
out that the	87
and even though	87
and thats exactly	87
what was happening	87
to look like	87
because i have	87
did not have	87
see it in	87
you wanted to	87
they tend to	87
in high school	87
less than a	87
a much more	87
are some of	87
you all know	86
so what im	86
try to make	86
to get there	86
was that the	86
that as a	86
but it doesnt	86
to help them	86
you see it	86
a very interesting	86
it is possible	86
a ted talk	86
the world but	86
back of the	86
know what to	86
there might be	86
the reason that	86
the number one	86
have a little	86
i think what	86
i am the	86
to start to	86
it this is	86
this is because	86
lets talk about	86
me in the	86
it may be	86
you can use	86
as a way	86
less likely to	86
with other people	86
didnt have to	86
why dont you	86
we start to	86
ought to be	86
of it and	86
written by a	85
going to come	85
the first of	85
them to the	85
in your body	85
the existence of	85
trying to make	85
to have an	85
are part of	85
what if you	85
is not about	85
its sort of	85
this in a	85
you cant see	85
can see in	85
that are going	85
there were a	85
only a few	85
can go to	85
the more we	85
and we started	85
i was trying	85
i took a	85
right in the	85
into the atmosphere	85
of the country	85
of the best	85
how is it	85
like to be	85
think about that	85
looked at me	85
and i really	85
of our time	85
out there and	85
to take you	85
on the back	85
know what i	85
to get rid	84
is a good	84
might want to	84
thats why i	84
but i do	84
to tell me	84
in that moment	84
what happened to	84
very good at	84
is that in	84
i going to	84
is just one	84
weve been able	84
an awful lot	84
made up of	84
give them a	84
i feel like	84
live in the	84
they go to	84
out of that	84
im just going	84
that they would	84
the ones who	84
i was at	84
third of the	84
to buy a	84
two or three	84
as youre thinking	84
to you is	84
in my mind	84
next generation of	84
the next time	84
i know this	84
in some ways	84
we were in	84
be used for	84
need to get	83
to the moon	83
up to me	83
so this was	83
and i knew	83
the world so	83
is probably the	83
it to you	83
up to a	83
the one who	83
here you see	83
and we would	83
see here is	83
was written by	83
a friend of	83
we are a	83
we will have	83
i came up	83
and that we	83
was the only	83
the vast majority	83
the big bang	83
if we had	83
was not a	83
dont know about	83
to put it	83
and what is	83
so much for	83
in the solar	83
vast majority of	83
one or two	83
on the continent	83
is that these	83
the beauty of	83
lots and lots	83
the time we	83
to be on	83
in that way	82
you will be	82
on the side	82
because i had	82
to the same	82
can you imagine	82
here are the	82
some of our	82
was a kid	82
you about the	82
say that the	82
of time and	82
that in a	82
there was something	82
to interact with	82
who have been	82
its a really	82
for thousands of	82
single one of	82
the year 2000	82
here we go	82
the laws of	82
when i say	82
it with the	82
piece of paper	82
way to get	82
dont know the	82
at the world	82
and they get	82
did you know	82
is that theres	82
a big deal	82
wanted to go	82
how does it	82
there was this	82
with all of	82
of these people	82
we would have	82
i said to	82
see on the	82
of your life	82
in my head	82
is a big	82
and put it	82
is called the	82
we had the	82
looking at a	82
in the sky	82
can do with	82
made out of	82
according to the	82
are people who	82
when we have	82
a year ago	82
went on to	82
is that people	82
every single one	82
that no one	82
on and on	82
to come and	82
and i decided	81
in response to	81
of life and	81
the fact is	81
i think if	81
at that moment	81
is that our	81
see a lot	81
to be so	81
thats not what	81
is just the	81
the past few	81
spent a lot	81
the evolution of	81
hes going to	81
out there in	81
of the big	81
of you in	81
need to find	81
members of the	81
let me just	81
you know the	81
the first person	81
its a great	81
because of that	81
of the city	81
the us government	81
in the 21st	81
and its been	81
the reason for	81
think that this	81
have to tell	81
of us and	81
a man who	81
part of it	81
look back at	81
was a lot	81
since i was	81
the higgs field	81
the life of	81
look like this	80
dont know why	80
and as the	80
tells us that	80
a pretty good	80
friends and family	80
more important than	80
had a lot	80
is what it	80
which you can	80
the question of	80
that it has	80
it with a	80
talk a little	80
so in this	80
part of what	80
front of you	80
these people are	80
want them to	80
to the people	80
just in the	80
is a new	80
and so in	80
which is very	80
of us to	80
we were to	80
and it can	80
about the same	80
billions of years	80
found is that	80
they didnt have	80
think it was	80
the point where	80
really going to	80
have a good	79
youre thinking about	79
and id like	79
in real life	79
i think were	79
she was a	79
we go to	79
into the future	79
do it and	79
it does not	79
one is the	79
from the sun	79
you can tell	79
not only do	79
we got a	79
a year and	79
to show that	79
if you wanted	79
found out that	79
and he had	79
and it wasnt	79
in a row	79
wanted to make	79
lets think about	79
didnt have a	79
a whole bunch	79
news is that	79
going on here	79
would love to	79
use it to	79
to leave the	79
anywhere in the	79
the issue of	79
different parts of	79
i hope you	79
of this year	79
reason is that	79
of you will	79
time i was	79
and the whole	79
to go and	79
out of your	79
on the street	79
thats the way	79
to the brain	79
do we get	79
going to die	79
the last two	79
what is a	79
in the late	79
living in the	79
so heres the	79
is a huge	79
picture of a	79
about a year	79
you were to	78
about it and	78
had a very	78
the time that	78
a pair of	78
what is happening	78
it would take	78
i found that	78
miles an hour	78
that we think	78
got to do	78
but then i	78
in just a	78
we really need	78
i come from	78
and its going	78
was a great	78
i showed you	78
i have an	78
as a kid	78
want to live	78
of those who	78
but what about	78
thats what were	78
is that all	78
the other day	78
two years ago	78
care about the	78
the impact of	78
here it is	78
do it with	78
think there are	78
that they dont	78
and we all	78
going to play	78
is an example	78
as we go	78
if i were	78
the time to	78
at the surface	78
on the streets	78
but let me	78
the right thing	78
and to do	78
we still have	77
ask the question	77
but the problem	77
world in which	77
need to take	77
which is not	77
is very important	77
a form of	77
fact that the	77
we see in	77
the reason i	77
doesnt mean that	77
just have to	77
deal with the	77
theres been a	77
been trying to	77
going back to	77
is this is	77
of like a	77
to begin to	77
a very large	77
rest of us	77
the last 10	77
so there are	77
where it is	77
to be there	77
the last year	77
a huge amount	77
in the sense	77
at least in	77
you realize that	77
now if you	77
to us and	77
us is that	77
these are not	77
but i also	77
the next one	77
the industrial revolution	77
of your own	77
for a minute	77
in this particular	77
of trying to	77
about 10 years	77
for all the	77
i became a	77
could do it	76
something that was	76
and then theres	76
and what that	76
know that they	76
from all over	76
a team of	76
did not know	76
this one is	76
for the most	76
last few years	76
really wanted to	76
you might have	76
that we get	76
sort of thing	76
i kind of	76
very difficult to	76
quality of life	76
that comes from	76
hard to get	76
to be done	76
in los angeles	76
be a good	76
and we should	76
be willing to	76
and we want	76
happens when you	76
all know that	76
you may not	76
have a look	76
is no longer	76
a little girl	76
well be able	76
there was an	76
and to be	76
has a lot	76
so many people	76
this is called	76
got to the	76
that the brain	76
his name is	76
because they dont	76
the next thing	76
and those who	76
world around us	76
all of my	76
that is to	76
but im not	76
this is true	76
if you ask	76
the shape of	75
a really good	75
kind of the	75
of the fact	75
do you get	75
meant to be	75
the need for	75
and figure out	75
so what you	75
and over the	75
if you just	75
when she was	75
lot of different	75
i dont mean	75
would you like	75
very similar to	75
and we also	75
got a little	75
them on the	75
you see on	75
a good idea	75
we know how	75
do not have	75
the world bank	75
i love you	75
i know i	75
we dont even	75
are much more	75
of carbon dioxide	75
in the developing	75
of what is	75
tell us that	75
who you are	75
this for a	75
on the table	75
with one of	75
to come out	75
huge amount of	75
we have not	75
and we said	75
to ensure that	75
what i would	75
thats a lot	75
so that i	75
me to do	74
now you can	74
so there is	74
what they want	74
way that i	74
it to a	74
i call it	74
the source of	74
dont even know	74
something called the	74
a combination of	74
to know the	74
is such a	74
that i know	74
known as the	74
any of you	74
change in the	74
more than the	74
would say that	74
whole bunch of	74
the courage to	74
to you and	74
to make us	74
so what were	74
get into the	74
you are in	74
they should be	74
of the new	74
and see what	74
a completely different	74
the very same	74
and so that	74
have to deal	74
because we dont	74
a period of	74
of what it	74
but for the	74
who i am	74
couple of weeks	74
seems to me	74
right now is	74
know that i	74
to continue to	74
them into the	74
so were going	74
now im going	74
these types of	74
there are lots	74
it was in	74
think it is	74
do in the	74
of how the	74
learned a lot	74
have shown that	73
whatever it is	73
the opposite of	73
is to say	73
its easy to	73
youre not going	73
living in a	73
the language of	73
first time i	73
on the moon	73
so i dont	73
you were a	73
ask you to	73
we continue to	73
they dont want	73
lots of different	73
so i did	73
how to get	73
fall in love	73
i could not	73
number of people	73
a question of	73
view of the	73
of these different	73
give us a	73
but as a	73
he said that	73
the world i	73
is supposed to	73
know that there	73
is the idea	73
goes to the	73
to get some	73
in the system	73
we could get	73
you like to	73
the purpose of	73
to be like	73
of the whole	73
is a bit	73
is that a	73
probably the most	73
didnt have the	73
pay attention to	73
not a lot	73
the part of	73
and the fact	73
to learn from	73
about how the	73
of the past	73
which is what	73
people in this	73
i ended up	73
next time you	72
the most amazing	72
dont have any	72
start with a	72
than we are	72
its got a	72
hours a day	72
in the name	72
as you know	72
a few things	72
for hundreds of	72
did you do	72
thats why we	72
so i would	72
here this is	72
like to share	72
and millions of	72
to take care	72
a couple years	72
history of the	72
where there are	72
for the world	72
and to the	72
as human beings	72
so all of	72
one on the	72
then we can	72
is a way	72
in the 19th	72
the essence of	72
but it has	72
and if they	72
see is that	72
but i didnt	72
believe that we	72
and they dont	72
that the only	72
they have no	72
are not going	72
to pick up	72
the worlds population	72
so what are	72
call it the	72
where are you	72
so the next	72
one of his	72
only in the	72
of a new	72
reality is that	72
and you might	72
at a certain	72
here to tell	72
the physical world	72
this is to	72
be used to	71
really have to	71
is where we	71
i found a	71
so if youre	71
not to be	71
the last time	71
a few hours	71
and here we	71
were about to	71
they would have	71
in the other	71
if you put	71
they were not	71
at least one	71
and ive been	71
quite a bit	71
and make it	71
are the only	71
that he would	71
very different from	71
from the very	71
just look at	71
trying to be	71
have to find	71
job is to	71
you get this	71
that makes us	71
you start to	71
this was an	71
the arab world	71
of what the	71
is about the	71
at a very	71
people that are	71
fell in love	71
when we were	71
not allowed to	71
how are we	71
i saw a	71
i had just	71
which is an	71
it and so	71
what if the	71
is to make	71
here you can	71
to solve the	71
so much of	71
what weve been	71
be the most	71
are all the	71
of the night	71
something about it	71
we have all	71
to them and	71
so you see	71
keep in mind	71
i didnt want	71
and we do	71
we can ask	70
learned how to	70
the power to	70
you can buy	70
what you want	70
of new york	70
as a young	70
it and the	70
its in the	70
to kind of	70
such as the	70
the place where	70
the world has	70
over to the	70
a place that	70
i found out	70
40 percent of	70
three or four	70
when it was	70
be on the	70
power of the	70
see the world	70
of the greatest	70
they were going	70
a few minutes	70
the second one	70
an opportunity to	70
people like me	70
a great deal	70
all you need	70
not just in	70
it felt like	70
what its like	70
you that the	70
is exactly what	70
like this is	70
know that its	70
year and a	70
when we get	70
is why i	70
you might say	70
each of us	70
working on the	70
exactly what we	70
who care about	70
is about a	70
and they did	70
does this mean	70
to be true	70
you had a	70
something about the	70
and when it	70
in a single	70
oclock in the	70
and thousands of	70
same kind of	70
its all about	70
a list of	70
we can start	70
we now know	70
and the people	70
on how to	70
understanding of the	70
what i wanted	70
say that i	70
are lots of	69
has not been	69
the production of	69
just wanted to	69
been in the	69
in the most	69
to a very	69
but they were	69
way in which	69
you about a	69
create a new	69
in the beginning	69
all the people	69
they were all	69
with some of	69
looks like this	69
me to be	69
and i see	69
how can you	69
to get them	69
that you might	69
might have been	69
the last one	69
that was really	69
we know the	69
i was on	69
thats a very	69
got a lot	69
and you could	69
we took a	69
this is from	69
different from the	69
the world it	69
the potential to	69
in my own	69
so for the	69
of a second	69
and how to	69
you end up	69
are you doing	69
to learn about	69
if they dont	69
look in the	69
because i want	69
on a daily	69
in spite of	69
thinking about this	69
sound of the	69
how did we	69
are more likely	69
so i just	69
can take a	69
the brain of	69
at the center	69
and i cant	69
a daily basis	69
countries in the	69
to keep the	69
lot of them	69
thats one of	69
weve been doing	69
if we just	69
the worlds most	69
and no one	69
have to remember	69
if it were	69
and one day	69
is that theyre	69
for some of	69
like you to	69
it is about	69
we could have	69
make sense of	69
something wrong with	68
think theres a	68
it kind of	68
what were trying	68
the person who	68
things we can	68
they were in	68
try to understand	68
changed my life	68
and the next	68
is the way	68
over the place	68
ready to go	68
want to ask	68
talk about a	68
it had to	68
he was the	68
going to help	68
for some reason	68
can be done	68
i should say	68
try to get	68
that she was	68
years of age	68
now in the	68
of the work	68
what i found	68
how are you	68
of how to	68
ive been working	68
was kind of	68
and thats where	68
who want to	68
have in the	68
next to the	68
is to take	68
which was a	68
few months ago	68
to go up	68
in some of	68
i dont like	68
at the other	68
as it turns	68
is also a	68
outside of the	68
work to do	68
an image of	68
theres a very	68
a high school	68
a half years	68
i was thinking	68
and youll see	68
the idea was	68
you should be	68
i have the	68
the country and	68
have the right	68
is why we	68
lot of these	68
on its own	68
or we can	67
even though the	67
try to figure	67
but on the	67
think we should	67
but we know	67
and instead of	67
30 percent of	67
its not like	67
its a good	67
and i felt	67
the space of	67
so they could	67
my father was	67
structure of the	67
means that the	67
all around us	67
so we did	67
no idea how	67
the core of	67
thought to myself	67
to some of	67
neurons in the	67
looking at this	67
its as if	67
15 years ago	67
have to use	67
world that we	67
around in the	67
that for a	67
what this means	67
to see this	67
president of the	67
way to go	67
in the ground	67
it allows us	67
and theyre going	67
your brain is	67
it used to	67
the only ones	67
coming up with	67
we already have	67
dont really know	67
it doesnt really	67
the benefits of	67
we did was	67
when i look	67
so that it	67
what happens in	67
i dont even	67
it that we	67
in your brain	67
in a place	67
the value of	67
and i feel	67
and in some	67
that part of	67
of us in	67
impact on the	67
thought i was	67
and in particular	67
and i couldnt	67
of the us	67
this is very	67
front of a	67
is like a	67
to create an	67
i mean by	67
the bottom line	67
the way down	67
the future and	67
is that were	67
25 percent of	67
the other person	66
to do more	66
not so much	66
the last decade	66
to the first	66
and after a	66
im saying is	66
me as a	66
there has been	66
of the two	66
new way of	66
that we call	66
we really want	66
are the same	66
wouldnt it be	66
no one has	66
it tells us	66
it seems that	66
to what we	66
to a place	66
which was the	66
it for a	66
we see a	66
the coast of	66
so we went	66
thats how it	66
whole lot of	66
but it can	66
and i looked	66
it so that	66
to be about	66
id like you	66
is there a	66
things like this	66
have been doing	66
that has to	66
things in the	66
the president of	66
wed like to	66
be a very	66
world that is	66
this is so	66
because there is	66
if we have	66
when i have	66
in a little	66
is the kind	66
can take the	66
we have is	66
because you have	66
at the heart	66
to play with	66
able to have	66
to write a	66
to help people	66
they are going	66
there may be	66
see if we	66
to get this	66
are one of	66
about the size	66
three and a	66
into the brain	66
it is so	66
to the end	66
a system that	66
about it is	66
it was also	66
than ever before	66
that ive been	66
order to make	66
whats happening in	66
laws of physics	66
so we decided	66
and thats when	65
one day i	65
we use to	65
is the fact	65
speed of light	65
not the same	65
it was that	65
i wrote a	65
to work together	65
so what does	65
what youre seeing	65
and the last	65
of the mind	65
were dealing with	65
reality as it	65
but that is	65
more than half	65
right next to	65
that has a	65
to save the	65
had to have	65
in the mid	65
we believe that	65
its something that	65
was the most	65
this is probably	65
course of the	65
the other end	65
at one point	65
what am i	65
see what happens	65
if we go	65
and not only	65
us and the	65
because in the	65
its the first	65
of a lot	65
to change our	65
that theyre going	65
three years ago	65
able to take	65
there are only	65
happens when we	65
and we just	65
maybe we should	65
we needed to	65
tell us about	65
the structure of	65
like to talk	65
do about it	65
it all the	65
and the third	65
as a society	65
the presence of	65
not a good	65
what they did	65
when we do	65
very interested in	65
what is going	65
we do know	65
and talk about	65
you need a	65
dont get me	65
to be happy	65
the rate of	65
if you get	65
of the car	65
orders of magnitude	65
was a big	65
to help me	65
other parts of	64
so on and	64
them and i	64
in less than	64
the last 20	64
to give them	64
which we can	64
in the global	64
it and we	64
and all that	64
led to the	64
that it could	64
in my country	64
of people are	64
but i believe	64
the panic monster	64
in the course	64
give me a	64
were working with	64
you have no	64
the next step	64
we were doing	64
we came up	64
the next 10	64
of the game	64
point is that	64
because we were	64
person in the	64
thing about this	64
really need to	64
it was possible	64
come in and	64
of course we	64
way that you	64
heres an example	64
it on a	64
a story of	64
know is that	64
we have some	64
he was going	64
us that we	64
it will take	64
to explain to	64
instead of the	64
but it wasnt	64
it has the	64
it and i	64
you a sense	64
do is we	64
here in this	64
first thing that	64
just a couple	64
we take the	64
we got to	64
the streets of	64
in a small	64
to the internet	64
that they need	64
of all these	64
now there are	64
at all of	64
you could do	64
way of thinking	64
go back and	64
get me wrong	64
so on the	64
up into the	64
and just like	64
i thought to	64
all going to	64
the people of	64
i think they	64
that im going	64
because if we	64
along with the	64
i know you	64
variety of different	64
very close to	64
get a lot	64
its also a	64
70 percent of	64
in the center	64
of course the	64
about what we	64
the most famous	64
and i do	64
i wish i	64
the possibility of	64
come from a	64
have to admit	63
five years ago	63
half a million	63
as a whole	63
would not be	63
to do now	63
and at that	63
but you dont	63
life on earth	63
if i can	63
is the one	63
that all the	63
and so when	63
its much more	63
there are so	63
of the entire	63
asked them to	63
can use to	63
a moment of	63
know that if	63
know that we	63
the earth and	63
the way of	63
and i learned	63
because i know	63
listening to the	63
happen in the	63
here at ted	63
be the same	63
we did not	63
one is a	63
get to see	63
and i love	63
in the background	63
theres so much	63
be the first	63
you dont see	63
that they will	63
that you need	63
we like to	63
it was so	63
a better life	63
the first day	63
he or she	63
happened to be	63
to participate in	63
i see a	63
what happens if	63
they could be	63
try to do	63
and this has	63
with the idea	63
what you are	63
would be able	63
know about the	63
an idea that	63
when you are	63
we can learn	63
i live in	63
based on a	63
the last thing	63
so now we	63
but what is	63
where they are	63
after a while	63
like i said	63
way to make	63
never seen before	63
just need to	62
head of the	62
the most beautiful	62
one percent of	62
let me explain	62
in the present	62
a question that	62
of the american	62
it a little	62
might look like	62
this could be	62
for the same	62
go through the	62
i was about	62
than it is	62
because he was	62
a few more	62
it was too	62
let go of	62
on it and	62
years ago when	62
and were not	62
but they dont	62
tell me that	62
and they all	62
why do you	62
is more than	62
the planet and	62
but the thing	62
you a story	62
doing the same	62
to sort of	62
world and the	62
day of the	62
something like a	62
to solve this	62
of you to	62
have to change	62
how to be	62
i was one	62
be a better	62
would want to	62
i thought it	62
wanted to see	62
that looks like	62
are the things	62
the north pole	62
on social media	62
people who had	62
its not even	62
so i could	62
because you can	62
that at the	62
where do you	62
so we are	62
is only one	62
so we could	62
for a living	62
its very hard	62
of the data	62
to put a	62
to a new	62
and we got	62
but the truth	62
in the region	62
lots of people	62
i was actually	62
the world its	62
the interesting thing	62
the whole of	62
there must be	62
i cant tell	62
that were not	62
in a new	62
that can do	62
and see if	62
the united kingdom	62
last 20 years	62
may be a	61
international space station	61
they have been	61
look at them	61
a few hundred	61
compared to the	61
the work that	61
thats kind of	61
other people and	61
and you want	61
we found is	61
about what it	61
to go in	61
thats a really	61
it was all	61
and for me	61
and every time	61
we had no	61
i go to	61
percent of people	61
us a lot	61
to be as	61
sitting in a	61
each of those	61
a function of	61
lot of you	61
you dont like	61
what we think	61
tons of carbon	61
are so many	61
it must be	61
i talk to	61
get people to	61
in my brain	61
actually going to	61
to start a	61
was a young	61
aware of the	61
in the forest	61
with one another	61
the lack of	61
need to make	61
youll see that	61
50 years ago	61
the future is	61
you will find	61
from the ground	61
do this with	61
should have been	61
the words of	61
on this stage	61
quite a lot	61
we asked them	61
sort of the	61
at all the	61
if this is	61
to wake up	61
and look for	61
what did you	61
i woke up	61
talk to me	61
that we live	61
in their lives	61
95 percent of	61
and i get	61
got to go	61
set up a	61
it sounds like	61
why we have	61
has always been	61
people that you	61
have been able	61
they do this	61
the international space	61
about all the	61
a certain point	61
as they are	61
want to leave	61
our understanding of	61
so here are	61
how many times	61
for coming to	61
was on the	61
not want to	61
where you are	61
who am i	61
theres no way	61
hard to do	61
tend to think	61
you care about	61
maybe we could	61
a network of	61
the absence of	61
many of our	61
i would never	61
no matter where	60
or is it	60
a big problem	60
my job is	60
even though we	60
they do it	60
i dont really	60
thanks to the	60
other things that	60
of this kind	60
is a problem	60
on the road	60
its not because	60
but more importantly	60
was a huge	60
wanted to get	60
would look like	60
ways in which	60
what im doing	60
is in a	60
i ask you	60
time that we	60
the past and	60
say that we	60
the most common	60
the world for	60
the nobel prize	60
out on a	60
as they were	60
thats not a	60
take a moment	60
the man who	60
can see from	60
lot of other	60
life in the	60
may not have	60
think of this	60
and guess what	60
where there is	60
to open up	60
thats how we	60
we began to	60
attention to the	60
after a few	60
we did that	60
to learn to	60
colleagues and i	60
for that matter	60
the result is	60
but im going	60
the order of	60
and what do	60
we can think	60
the things i	60
thats where the	60
across the country	60
but it does	60
the universe and	60
i felt like	60
i could see	60
how we think	60
but i would	60
things that were	60
want to change	60
can see its	60
are capable of	60
i dont understand	60
new york and	60
on climate change	60
that the people	60
that he had	60
idea that we	60
as we can	60
i would go	60
as a scientist	60
they were doing	60
have to stop	60
thing that you	60
i call this	60
in this picture	60
are starting to	60
can make it	60
done in the	60
we have these	60
are at the	60
we do with	60
and they didnt	60
taking care of	60
around the globe	60
but they also	60
to get us	60
not because of	60
cant tell you	59
me on the	59
it for the	59
if there are	59
if i wanted	59
one thing i	59
in a moment	59
the one thing	59
you have this	59
is this a	59
what you would	59
something to do	59
to be at	59
the type of	59
the scale of	59
you is that	59
to improve our	59
a better world	59
could see the	59
to begin with	59
thats what you	59
between the two	59
its very important	59
years ago in	59
and over and	59
so heres a	59
way we can	59
we tried to	59
there were no	59
new kinds of	59
and the key	59
could it be	59
in touch with	59
and i still	59
do you remember	59
that i should	59
has been the	59
us to create	59
but most of	59
of the 20th	59
of a very	59
go to school	59
down the road	59
five years old	59
put it into	59
million tons of	59
so it can	59
how does this	59
but if youre	59
but now we	59
and how much	59
if you give	59
we think we	59
it as an	59
the long term	59
to play a	59
get them to	59
brings me to	59
sense of self	59
we dont just	59
and how it	59
right here in	59
it doesnt mean	59
the real thing	59
would go to	59
name of the	59
to take that	59
a young man	59
who are in	59
is it possible	59
to one another	59
some of it	59
i can use	59
it makes you	59
found that the	59
the last couple	59
can start to	59
even though it	59
to make you	59
as simple as	59
i just wanted	59
and the result	59
to be brave	59
of time in	59
but i will	59
more than 100	59
changes in the	59
not at all	59
the reality of	59
of all this	59
and talk to	59
but because of	59
in order for	59
is we have	59
get access to	58
not have a	58
but in a	58
the second is	58
you would expect	58
coming back to	58
if it is	58
each other in	58
every day and	58
and theres no	58
there is another	58
and the best	58
that are being	58
you have an	58
one out of	58
and you cant	58
and i told	58
at each other	58
that were all	58
a country that	58
to reach out	58
like to say	58
you are the	58
answer to that	58
we can understand	58
of thinking about	58
and again and	58
is really a	58
was talking about	58
if we take	58
at this moment	58
to protect the	58
they might be	58
billions of dollars	58
a small group	58
because its not	58
probably going to	58
would happen if	58
and the problem	58
a very powerful	58
i hope to	58
is it a	58
looked at it	58
goal is to	58
and as it	58
in the street	58
down the street	58
allow them to	58
had nothing to	58
and we get	58
because i dont	58
sense of what	58
what youre looking	58
to convince you	58
for the people	58
was at the	58
at least a	58
be interested in	58
want to use	58
the same kind	58
the one on	58
why is this	58
needed to be	58
soon as i	58
came to the	58
is a real	58
this is exactly	58
the time they	58
realized that i	58
people that we	58
is known as	58
we realized that	58
here on the	58
they may be	58
want to start	58
of people that	58
but how do	58
a world of	58
i will not	58
what weve done	58
its not an	58
what i really	58
and you are	58
to measure the	58
something that would	58
the best of	58
i feel that	58
and its just	58
it was actually	58
coming to ted	58
so instead of	58
women and men	58
they told me	58
to want to	58
just like a	58
of the next	58
have come to	58
and it makes	58
it makes me	58
boys and girls	58
we call them	58
my life i	57
a place of	57
on one side	57
the theory of	57
are living in	57
any one of	57
the world this	57
so much about	57
to explore the	57
what if i	57
all the different	57
what youre doing	57
can i do	57
led me to	57
i did a	57
what this is	57
like to have	57
it this way	57
that you will	57
look like a	57
that i wanted	57
this is another	57
not only the	57
millions of dollars	57
reason why we	57
new kind of	57
want it to	57
none of the	57
and then finally	57
i started thinking	57
the ground and	57
that was not	57
but you have	57
when we got	57
the world the	57
middle of a	57
to help you	57
when we talk	57
is that even	57
people are going	57
of their lives	57
got to get	57
there is the	57
we use the	57
but also the	57
the help of	57
willing to do	57
we did is	57
most of all	57
lets see what	57
that you had	57
have so much	57
in the long	57
that the human	57
you believe that	57
that is very	57
able to find	57
it and then	57
figure out the	57
a half million	57
but that doesnt	57
not all of	57
way that the	57
were working on	57
but then we	57
can create a	57
was looking for	57
its the most	57
them to do	57
each of the	57
its time to	57
means to be	57
believe in the	57
my colleagues and	57
is it really	57
able to tell	57
to take this	57
talk about how	57
and i came	57
a very big	57
out from the	57
thousands and thousands	57
in the front	57
what i learned	57
it doesnt work	57
a handful of	57
to have this	57
but the most	57
as we were	57
can be the	57
why this is	57
faster than the	57
and that would	57
with a very	56
lot of it	56
of other things	56
of the sea	56
back to a	56
amount of money	56
me and said	56
remain carbon neutral	56
a member of	56
i do not	56
make the world	56
you know this	56
if theres a	56
picture of the	56
but we do	56
the bad news	56
billion years ago	56
but one thing	56
because of our	56
that i do	56
in the 1970s	56
but in this	56
very important to	56
during the day	56
and as youre	56
have a big	56
so its very	56
gives us a	56
the water and	56
the need to	56
take advantage of	56
this was not	56
a million people	56
what it feels	56
ive been a	56
about a third	56
a lot like	56
to take it	56
have nothing to	56
we can turn	56
there was one	56
want to understand	56
because thats what	56
all the same	56
know what youre	56
the world who	56
everyone in the	56
people want to	56
to the very	56
hundred years ago	56
the question that	56
future freedom of	56
so what happens	56
freedom of action	56
to you today	56
happen to be	56
in the western	56
i have this	56
now have a	56
because there was	56
he wants to	56
years ago we	56
by and large	56
thats not true	56
so lets look	56
we know what	56
is not to	56
an idea of	56
take a step	56
example of a	56
you to take	56
to remain carbon	56
we found a	56
right now in	56
for the other	56
member of the	56
to the bottom	56
and if it	56
im interested in	56
have a new	56
the origin of	56
instead of being	56
to get that	56
what will happen	56
that are the	56
it up and	56
that what we	56
of my talk	56
but i know	56
that you get	56
tell the story	56
you do not	56
most of these	56
less than one	56
that come from	56
she had a	56
in this audience	56
thing you can	56
individuals with autism	56
turn out to	56
last 10 years	56
in the streets	56
in the south	56
martin luther king	56
he was in	56
we knew that	56
billion dollars a	56
explain to you	56
and if the	56
a way for	55
and they go	55
and those are	55
that its going	55
the most successful	55
it out of	55
example of the	55
better than the	55
nature of the	55
to pay attention	55
that have the	55
i lived in	55
to the ground	55
more about the	55
things are going	55
that doesnt mean	55
30 years ago	55
do i mean	55
solve this problem	55
that we might	55
thats a good	55
to the second	55
i work with	55
of this as	55
are they going	55
what is your	55
if you see	55
what can i	55
we can build	55
to make things	55
it takes to	55
do with it	55
in the 20th	55
now that we	55
100 percent of	55
thats what it	55
but before i	55
not only in	55
turn it into	55
and he has	55
so they dont	55
as fast as	55
found was that	55
as you go	55
would have a	55
we get the	55
how can i	55
thing in the	55
can do a	55
this is when	55
a few seconds	55
where i live	55
in the media	55
to give us	55
that i did	55
and how do	55
today i want	55
know about you	55
gave me a	55
the first part	55
but they have	55
of the very	55
so at this	55
its a lot	55
it becomes a	55
to people who	55
we need is	55
realized that the	55
which is just	55
talk about that	55
60 percent of	55
of a million	55
to a lot	55
you in this	55
of his life	55
i really want	55
that we actually	55
the human genome	55
the arab spring	55
a better way	55
lucky enough to	55
if there is	55
was actually a	55
these are some	55
do it for	55
can you do	55
the sum of	55
i can go	55
four or five	55
something called a	55
women in the	55
but if i	55
awful lot of	55
the developed world	55
like to tell	55
this is happening	55
show you some	55
and you would	55
allowing us to	55
which is one	55
there and i	55
state of the	55
want to put	55
see what we	55
do what i	55
imagine if we	55
because when you	55
it was to	55
the more you	55
i did it	55
lets go back	55
and then she	55
this is important	55
and what are	55
and once we	54
i have my	54
we can say	54
the ceo of	54
the color of	54
than the other	54
it that way	54
because i didnt	54
we use a	54
if you havent	54
just in case	54
is very simple	54
fact that they	54
in the human	54
to me is	54
some of that	54
of my friends	54
and when he	54
so in fact	54
theres actually a	54
to help the	54
and im sure	54
on behalf of	54
front of us	54
like to see	54
truth is that	54
have lots of	54
comes out of	54
was a really	54
every single person	54
the cause of	54
to the left	54
example of how	54
in those days	54
as you see	54
so much that	54
despite the fact	54
in the summer	54
i was told	54
of the problems	54
we were looking	54
to come together	54
in the second	54
end up in	54
in the arab	54
the meaning of	54
percent of them	54
but i had	54
working on a	54
your hand if	54
there are things	54
it from the	54
to give up	54
to give the	54
and so its	54
such a thing	54
rest of my	54
due to the	54
you some of	54
get a job	54
being in the	54
dealing with the	54
we would be	54
a robot that	54
my life and	54
said that the	54
the tip of	54
of young people	54
with the world	54
it comes from	54
introduce you to	54
the growth of	54
as you get	54
of you might	54
dont think we	54
long time ago	54
that is why	54
and for that	54
the study of	54
long time to	54
and with that	54
the way in	54
and i made	54
as a species	54
we should do	54
do we want	54
so as a	54
other way around	54
show you that	54
climate change and	54
is the problem	54
i had my	54
depends on the	54
to a certain	54
we did a	54
if youre going	54
in the eyes	54
and thats just	54
closer to the	54
to do all	54
were on the	54
a place to	54
the surface and	54
you know about	54
were starting to	54
you would see	54
to give it	54
seemed to be	54
its really hard	54
about the brain	54
i were to	54
on the web	54
that we didnt	54
i know its	53
to stand up	53
and that makes	53
dont do that	53
of the ways	53
is a kind	53
been talking about	53
it is now	53
able to be	53
it was this	53
in to the	53
so there was	53
sitting in the	53
you take the	53
be the case	53
so it is	53
a really big	53
control of the	53
so hard to	53
image of the	53
have time to	53
of a few	53
to work and	53
is a beautiful	53
be a part	53
to engage in	53
we built a	53
no one had	53
for those who	53
are willing to	53
thousands of times	53
and then when	53
of the house	53
to this day	53
in the military	53
all these different	53
just a matter	53
all across the	53
do this in	53
the field of	53
used to say	53
the first few	53
bit like a	53
and things like	53
10 to the	53
youre in a	53
me when i	53
a world in	53
what did we	53
to get in	53
in the movie	53
think we all	53
when we see	53
and in order	53
you are going	53
give you some	53
of like the	53
in and out	53
i did the	53
if you like	53
isnt going to	53
the stuff that	53
by a human	53
from all the	53
i think weve	53
none of us	53
of people and	53
and they take	53
more of the	53
i saw that	53
that you know	53
so here we	53
time of the	53
or the other	53
to build the	53
youd have to	53
in the lower	53
just like this	53
answer is yes	53
so you dont	53
percent of those	53
thats going on	53
i had never	53
there are all	53
take for granted	53
on our planet	53
live in an	53
so we dont	53
know what you	53
when youre in	53
the next year	53
in a minute	53
enough to be	53
we found out	53
to be this	53
its very difficult	53
talk about what	53
to learn that	53
why would you	53
there are thousands	53
we do have	53
that allows us	53
i worked with	53
its a bit	53
in silicon valley	53
do what they	53
going through the	53
the design of	53
this part of	53
now you have	53
and the rest	53
we ended up	53
its a story	53
its up to	53
the sense that	52
tell us what	52
there is some	52
find out that	52
rid of the	52
to call it	52
see in this	52
like in the	52
that you should	52
the creation of	52
think of as	52
than you are	52
must have been	52
the white house	52
now let me	52
going to bring	52
down on the	52
or you can	52
its time for	52
you can put	52
of your body	52
if any of	52
how this works	52
in the atmosphere	52
i love that	52
the world trade	52
going to solve	52
well as the	52
i really like	52
dont have enough	52
work on this	52
at the data	52
and youve got	52
if we think	52
and make a	52
made in the	52
which i think	52
thats what im	52
not only to	52
how long it	52
get to a	52
i have never	52
were doing is	52
going to build	52
and weve got	52
the world would	52
in a more	52
is a map	52
is true of	52
was supposed to	52
so even though	52
turns out the	52
when i saw	52
i call the	52
but for me	52
that would have	52
it was my	52
out of poverty	52
in an age	52
how to deal	52
he has a	52
of a small	52
inside of the	52
of those people	52
much more likely	52
its got to	52
day in the	52
she was the	52
heart of the	52
i needed to	52
the sun is	52
what you might	52
it makes a	52
we call this	52
small group of	52
they are in	52
able to use	52
from one of	52
the things they	52
go on to	52
you think the	52
we have two	52
and i also	52
point in time	52
what would it	52
story of the	52
but all of	52
idea of what	52
you should have	52
are not just	52
because it has	52
we know from	52
just as much	52
five percent of	52
came back to	52
and they also	52
we have today	52
so the idea	52
do we know	52
want to hear	52
i got my	52
i believe we	52
what they found	52
you go back	52
to get on	52
know what im	52
i see the	52
like to call	52
you could see	52
talking about it	52
and now i	52
two of them	52
thought about it	52
it is also	52
get back to	52
might be thinking	52
the time when	52
dimensions of space	52
not as a	52
believe it or	52
youll see the	52
to make these	52
on its head	52
of the sun	52
it wasnt until	52
theyre trying to	52
on the earth	52
might not be	52
to speak to	51
i got the	51
and so he	51
and many other	51
there is not	51
how should we	51
in a certain	51
cant do that	51
for a couple	51
i do it	51
in the wrong	51
a story that	51
that is going	51
the third thing	51
and tried to	51
the outside world	51
they did not	51
had a little	51
it every day	51
go down to	51
of you know	51
want to build	51
i would not	51
can see a	51
has the same	51
edge of the	51
order to get	51
are a couple	51
corner of the	51
in the 60s	51
the most exciting	51
so many other	51
five or six	51
can also be	51
now i have	51
wants to be	51
in places like	51
are working on	51
i asked them	51
the status quo	51
everything that we	51
in a matter	51
not just to	51
in our body	51
if you cant	51
in the car	51
know if you	51
from the beginning	51
a lot better	51
a range of	51
the most interesting	51
of the word	51
this is your	51
allow you to	51
cant help but	51
day after day	51
is just as	51
want to look	51
the left is	51
was not the	51
so many different	51
things that make	51
we gave them	51
is really the	51
people think that	51
quarter of a	51
as i say	51
you to tell	51
it it was	51
will have to	51
the solution to	51
and it goes	51
if you didnt	51
first thing i	51
and i put	51
out of every	51
shape of the	51
going to turn	51
but it didnt	51
i know how	51
the eyes of	51
what we really	51
feel like a	51
does it mean	51
connected to the	51
wasnt going to	51
when i came	51
will continue to	51
on the outside	51
can see them	51
on the world	51
all of their	51
but the real	51
the private sector	51
would not have	51
didnt even know	51
so id like	51
and just as	51
were willing to	51
the extra dimensions	51
but he was	51
now of course	51
can see what	51
a few people	51
now take a	51
of people have	51
is the new	51
theyre not going	51
up and i	51
im not talking	51
was when i	51
the technology to	51
one of their	51
of the largest	51
in the gulf	51
the world was	51
i was asked	51
other thing that	51
but what does	51
like a lot	51
on the first	51
we care about	51
who was a	51
it so i	51
ive had to	51
can learn from	51
all of your	51
a level of	51
every time we	51
many of those	50
story of how	50
to be honest	50
majority of the	50
because of its	50
the behavior of	50
you who are	50
that i just	50
this into a	50
so as to	50
is not what	50
of some of	50
to pay for	50
the other things	50
look at our	50
the brain that	50
that came out	50
i would argue	50
the time you	50
the right way	50
those people who	50
out of control	50
to be made	50
has nothing to	50
were not just	50
know how much	50
it is for	50
so we thought	50
way we think	50
who are not	50
to know why	50
is the moment	50
in your own	50
which is called	50
you will have	50
we give them	50
has shown that	50
a tiny bit	50
that we find	50
going to learn	50
there are still	50
one third of	50
with you today	50
and the right	50
its part of	50
can go ahead	50
and it seems	50
you dont get	50
but i did	50
the truth and	50
i believe in	50
whats interesting is	50
ability to make	50
if youve ever	50
where are we	50
you and me	50
at all and	50
fact that i	50
i will never	50
familiar with the	50
the other half	50
the world where	50
the first question	50
the day that	50
you think its	50
when we are	50
use the same	50
because of a	50
look at me	50
where are the	50
the right time	50
is we can	50
next few years	50
have to give	50
but we didnt	50
as well so	50
brain and the	50
and now its	50
when you put	50
we will see	50
comes from a	50
why we are	50
i asked him	50
me and i	50
i dont believe	50
we go from	50
you might want	50
people who dont	50
there it is	50
need to change	50
it is our	50
a state of	50
would be to	50
thats the first	50
thats what the	50
from the outside	50
listen to the	50
my wife and	50
that for the	50
what can you	50
to the public	50
in the body	50
what he did	50
not be able	50
this means is	50
space and time	50
my entire life	50
the hum is	50
than just a	50
and he would	50
and so thats	50
he has to	50
a point where	50
we call a	50
look for the	50
but i just	50
of other people	50
and i are	50
their ability to	50
to work for	50
in relation to	50
to the fact	50
us to the	50
we actually have	50
are a few	50
much of it	50
we find that	50
is sort of	50
who is the	50
are just a	50
like i was	50
of the room	50
in the hands	50
make a lot	50
sitting on the	50
i get a	50
because we know	50
would it be	50
of the computer	49
going to become	49
fact that you	49
are a little	49
has a very	49
over the country	49
us in the	49
one of your	49
i really wanted	49
this is only	49
it look like	49
of our planet	49
us to go	49
important thing to	49
started thinking about	49
the first to	49
of my time	49
of the project	49
its not only	49
in recent years	49
its not enough	49
was part of	49
ha ha ha	49
where do we	49
are used to	49
to be much	49
a few examples	49
they had no	49
as an example	49
at the table	49
to live with	49
they used to	49
was sort of	49
in the amazon	49
we could use	49
about some of	49
get away from	49
we begin to	49
we use it	49
the base of	49
we really have	49
realize that the	49
on all the	49
in what we	49
sure that we	49
could be the	49
with lots of	49
had to get	49
think about a	49
the tools to	49
and get it	49
is so much	49
move on to	49
just trying to	49
do we make	49
we dont see	49
that what i	49
in its own	49
figure it out	49
the search for	49
one day and	49
what were looking	49
of the galaxy	49
and that will	49
is at the	49
know what they	49
it can also	49
here i am	49
it starts with	49
and in many	49
on the phone	49
and you will	49
why cant we	49
turns out its	49
and to make	49
the people around	49
and that i	49
have a different	49
what if there	49
enough to make	49
so i got	49
that on the	49
then there was	49
the fear of	49
and i used	49
even though i	49
them with a	49
talking to you	49
but you cant	49
coming from the	49
in the community	49
to go from	49
in the old	49
to care about	49
was in a	49
know a lot	49
we dont do	49
to show the	49
its about the	49
the rules of	49
less and less	49
working with the	49
for us is	49
and this one	49
allows you to	49
has never been	49
im about to	49
and theyre not	49
but as we	49
that makes you	49
we found was	49
weve been working	49
different kind of	49
talking about is	49
one way to	49
to rely on	49
that when i	49
big part of	49
what you have	49
need to understand	49
its just that	49
in our world	49
and one thing	49
us to look	49
a little while	49
a fraction of	49
might be the	49
and when that	49
climate change is	49
and we thought	49
that not only	48
thing i want	48
there are about	48
so in my	48
and for us	48
and what this	48
in our community	48
please raise your	48
you feel like	48
who wanted to	48
to get through	48
us to see	48
rest of your	48
used as a	48
there are actually	48
to go down	48
do that with	48
that are in	48
you could have	48
to study the	48
i realized i	48
which is really	48
what you need	48
not in a	48
they were the	48
and even the	48
they look like	48
all have a	48
to believe in	48
to suggest that	48
you a few	48
and it also	48
is a place	48
in south africa	48
used to have	48
it to me	48
we make a	48
to do but	48
going to end	48
year after year	48
of the global	48
very much for	48
there is this	48
is actually the	48
an age of	48
that are more	48
and why is	48
promise to remain	48
in a car	48
is to have	48
to maximize future	48
do things that	48
time this is	48
way that it	48
just think about	48
we take this	48
it if you	48
theres lots of	48
want to come	48
that it doesnt	48
but that was	48
the next two	48
what the hell	48
theres a whole	48
i started working	48
is it about	48
see that we	48
when they get	48
the reasons why	48
did we get	48
are we doing	48
this can be	48
and its also	48
to be when	48
a step back	48
is a wonderful	48
like that and	48
this idea that	48
but it would	48
we are at	48
and most importantly	48
pretty much the	48
i sort of	48
does not have	48
why are you	48
that make us	48
in a time	48
that is how	48
running out of	48
to search for	48
have a problem	48
we had an	48
it took me	48
is the second	48
have to start	48
about how much	48
what we find	48
the science of	48
the media lab	48
the distribution of	48
a really important	48
one is that	48
like this this	48
now is the	48
know how many	48
people ask me	48
to me i	48
for a lot	48
to other people	48
as a tool	48
i see it	48
it wasnt a	48
cant do it	48
would you do	48
not have the	48
up in my	48
ended up in	48
the start of	48
from around the	48
see it as	48
it gives us	48
just at the	48
the problem was	48
to make sense	48
nothing more than	48
it be that	48
who was the	48
that is so	48
to point out	48
i dont need	48
i think a	48
of dark energy	48
we have about	48
why should we	48
i love this	48
of the food	48
that the earth	48
and sort of	48
i learned a	48
its really important	48
of these are	48
and into the	48
and you say	48
thinking about it	48
found a way	48
for a year	48
and then in	48
the south pole	48
hundreds of years	48
i went through	48
that people have	48
to do about	48
order to be	48
to make an	47
and we put	47
i went on	47
its been a	47
you might not	47
in the moment	47
you cant get	47
a difference in	47
top of that	47
would be that	47
most of those	47
and put them	47
in many cases	47
to be seen	47
think thats a	47
that theres no	47
see that in	47
but were not	47
in the wild	47
that i love	47
theres going to	47
and i look	47
have not been	47
work on the	47
and then to	47
things that have	47
working on it	47
just like you	47
you think you	47
im here today	47
and change the	47
we did the	47
felt like i	47
they didnt know	47
pick it up	47
and what was	47
you would be	47
as i mentioned	47
at this time	47
look at some	47
the way up	47
at it and	47
first thing we	47
are thousands of	47
we should have	47
to feel like	47
so what if	47
long as you	47
other end of	47
not a single	47
it going to	47
more like this	47
i do think	47
i came back	47
on the basis	47
run out of	47
let me talk	47
what happened was	47
and we asked	47
everything in the	47
we were really	47
you grow up	47
are things that	47
because you dont	47
they look at	47
it started with	47
the world right	47
going to create	47
is that weve	47
we were a	47
cents a mile	47
dont talk about	47
i talked to	47
if youre in	47
are supposed to	47
just take a	47
tens of millions	47
hole in the	47
that every single	47
of the solar	47
the world as	47
so many things	47
do a little	47
wake up in	47
the best thing	47
going to spend	47
the brains of	47
so how can	47
and we went	47
an enormous amount	47
answer the question	47
of human beings	47
was about to	47
why am i	47
to make our	47
step back and	47
of your brain	47
lot of fun	47
if i have	47
and so if	47
at all times	47
they are also	47
and all these	47
know the answer	47
give you the	47
only going to	47
and in our	47
do that in	47
is so important	47
i was an	47
thats when i	47
heres what i	47
he had to	47
order of magnitude	47
it is this	47
where they were	47
with the help	47
with them and	47
because i am	47
shes going to	47
me i was	47
so i hope	47
are the people	47
which is about	47
were kind of	47
be the only	47
what ive been	47
that in order	47
we were trying	47
the last five	47
would have had	47
the natural world	47
and weve been	47
of you here	47
in the book	47
find out how	47
that he could	47
im working on	47
so what that	47
the area of	47
a community of	47
dont know that	47
put them on	47
i was also	46
i thank you	46
a culture of	46
and can be	46
invite you to	46
the needs of	46
the diversity of	46
going to win	46
us to make	46
way of doing	46
a place for	46
to you that	46
when you start	46
i didnt really	46
and thats really	46
have to work	46
about the fact	46
to me in	46
how you can	46
so i know	46
of us can	46
as good as	46
they began to	46
would be very	46
and she had	46
and she has	46
and so my	46
maybe we can	46
and each of	46
he would have	46
in some sense	46
if we did	46
two weeks ago	46
dont really understand	46
the brain stem	46
they end up	46
we are trying	46
of them have	46
very easy to	46
you know who	46
can imagine the	46
you call it	46
in my view	46
world and i	46
new type of	46
were used to	46
i had done	46
now theres a	46
youre thinking of	46
the ocean and	46
to the future	46
to build an	46
look at your	46
figuring out how	46
they can get	46
and be able	46
like it was	46
and his team	46
do this is	46
every single time	46
that made me	46
between these two	46
you say to	46
have a choice	46
and with the	46
we did this	46
a week later	46
but this was	46
were beginning to	46
have never been	46
i saw the	46
what were seeing	46
why would we	46
the consequences of	46
we did it	46
form of life	46
the present moment	46
come together and	46
thought that was	46
able to look	46
you make a	46
on one of	46
in our lives	46
we do in	46
the only person	46
need a new	46
do things like	46
think of a	46
just like we	46
the left side	46
two to three	46
on the idea	46
because we had	46
i moved to	46
were a lot	46
the percentage of	46
a bad thing	46
good for the	46
go on and	46
and from that	46
me about the	46
out the window	46
ive been trying	46
so i asked	46
the most part	46
them and so	46
the nervous system	46
i am going	46
what it really	46
kind of work	46
do that is	46
to understand why	46
a million times	46
was looking at	46
these sorts of	46
what it does	46
a really interesting	46
section of the	46
think that its	46
look like in	46
may not know	46
is more important	46
areas of the	46
enormous amount of	46
i would love	46
is not something	46
a model of	46
its not as	46
think that if	46
has the potential	46
can use this	46
could do that	46
lot of times	46
that the first	46
they do that	46
idea of a	46
in north america	46
came to me	46
also have to	46
you give them	46
we could actually	46
they going to	46
our sense of	46
talked about the	46
for one thing	46
we discovered that	46
like to know	46
find ways to	46
find out what	46
a lot in	46
the slime mold	46
what we dont	46
the voice of	46
a problem in	46
we have now	46
while we were	46
asked me to	46
past few years	46
are talking about	46
able to build	46
have a chance	46
do it again	46
one that i	46
it and thats	46
that people can	46
somebody who is	45
had the opportunity	45
for it and	45
a little kid	45
want to try	45
i can remember	45
see if you	45
as i did	45
scientists and engineers	45
in the cloud	45
we just need	45
talk to them	45
return to the	45
actually look at	45
am going to	45
i told him	45
which is how	45
we kind of	45
a person who	45
you to the	45
the emergence of	45
thinking about how	45
the time the	45
that makes it	45
they try to	45
i can get	45
need to look	45
black and white	45
four years ago	45
we get a	45
a straight line	45
in which you	45
gives you a	45
when they are	45
dont think that	45
do something that	45
with a new	45
look a little	45
kind of stuff	45
from the fact	45
he was able	45
but some of	45
but these are	45
then there are	45
level of the	45
a moment to	45
we put it	45
you get in	45
if there were	45
of love and	45
the stories of	45
the rise of	45
i can take	45
a big part	45
in charge of	45
out a way	45
just the right	45
idea that the	45
back to this	45
is a pretty	45
does it work	45
to respond to	45
get a better	45
this is kind	45
was that i	45
so ive been	45
white picket fence	45
the only place	45
no such thing	45
the global economy	45
started with a	45
can figure out	45
to understand it	45
it was going	45
last year and	45
who is a	45
that live in	45
that in mind	45
have been the	45
on my own	45
you hear the	45
can lead to	45
do we go	45
to admit that	45
in my case	45
number of neurons	45
weve had to	45
what do they	45
in the mirror	45
the case that	45
if you use	45
around the house	45
so what can	45
used to think	45
couple of days	45
one by one	45
you to be	45
they are a	45
had to take	45
who wants to	45
for people who	45
i really think	45
together to make	45
years after the	45
be aware of	45
and its this	45
you have been	45
do that for	45
not just that	45
i saw this	45
of the few	45
far away from	45
any of us	45
because when i	45
in every single	45
have a brain	45
and now you	45
to where i	45
to reduce the	45
where you have	45
other people in	45
worry about the	45
of them in	45
an act of	45
because they had	45
was the kind	45
were supposed to	45
we will not	45
look forward to	45
they are and	45
lead to a	45
the effect of	45
have a question	45
feels like to	45
interesting is that	45
so as i	45
to the front	45
of what they	45
who dont have	45
closer and closer	45
the weight of	45
in the news	45
too many people	45
because when we	45
could do this	45
i started my	45
dont like it	45
but then you	45
and at some	45
place where you	45
a video game	45
result of that	45
back to work	45
is less than	45
earlier this year	45
solar and wind	45
world is a	45
at all in	45
both of them	45
in the hospital	45
enable us to	45
these are just	45
i love to	45
on the edge	45
so as we	45
last couple of	45
in our lab	45
is not enough	45
of the questions	44
on the fact	44
of course i	44
we might not	44
up and then	44
of people around	44
can afford to	44
we can find	44
was something that	44
didnt have any	44
and they need	44
lets have a	44
to the hospital	44
we had this	44
the gay agenda	44
have been in	44
about five years	44
dont think so	44
i would do	44
because of what	44
hubble space telescope	44
to bring the	44
is what makes	44
want to think	44
he said to	44
and we cant	44
to survive and	44
saying is that	44
want me to	44
we have seen	44
in the desert	44
osama bin laden	44
theyre able to	44
can use the	44
of more than	44
need to see	44
solve the problem	44
of my work	44
there on the	44
that used to	44
i have two	44
nothing at all	44
it you can	44
the more they	44
countries around the	44
are looking at	44
we as a	44
and for a	44
i decided that	44
is happening in	44
might as well	44
to those who	44
i am so	44
but as i	44
i dont care	44
of it but	44
just to give	44
say to me	44
have to know	44
but i wanted	44
bottom line is	44
countries that are	44
make any sense	44
it means is	44
we do to	44
would have no	44
the western world	44
to give me	44
of billions of	44
and around the	44
dont have that	44
youre looking for	44
were the only	44
i think one	44
experience of the	44
to control the	44
can begin to	44
that was in	44
they didnt want	44
in a room	44
in the 1960s	44
in a position	44
can talk about	44
thats not how	44
we are able	44
by the same	44
the most popular	44
was at a	44
to address the	44
and the brain	44
we are to	44
i know a	44
in a box	44
people used to	44
lot of us	44
i got this	44
of looking at	44
encourage you to	44
of the solution	44
i sat down	44
this will be	44
i could go	44
the fate of	44
these are people	44
them that they	44
i talk about	44
a sense that	44
how much of	44
we can measure	44
and i find	44
much more like	44
to the human	44
what we saw	44
what are they	44
and what if	44
was that we	44
you know it	44
a good job	44
how to play	44
we talked about	44
now you might	44
you cant have	44
rather than the	44
that tells us	44
in which people	44
then i started	44
and i began	44
she wanted to	44
you can change	44
no way to	44
of the community	44
is the next	44
even if i	44
to ask the	44
not have to	44
its because of	44
to have more	44
with people who	44
ever want to	44
thing that makes	44
the year we	44
and what were	44
given to us	44
really important to	44
is where the	44
of work and	44
the last 50	44
to do some	44
that we face	44
to stay in	44
to me to	44
but what was	44
so im not	44
a computer and	44
theres not a	44
the last century	44
to let go	44
to new york	44
go through this	44
let me take	44
the perspective of	44
a very special	44
ive been doing	44
us that the	44
six months ago	43
to go for	43
four and a	43
to be sure	43
way that they	43
not the case	43
sounds like a	43
the discovery of	43
give it a	43
is a story	43
on earth is	43
doesnt have a	43
many other things	43
now going to	43
when you grow	43
been around for	43
in which he	43
to find that	43
you what i	43
we want the	43
of human nature	43
right now so	43
you do with	43
in the classroom	43
as quickly as	43
the potential for	43
times a day	43
the american dream	43
i fell in	43
it is and	43
and looked at	43
so thats a	43
and even in	43
is now a	43
it is very	43
both of these	43
where were going	43
there are those	43
much the same	43
to ask for	43
to a point	43
and we actually	43
of these two	43
lot of good	43
so much so	43
that when the	43
and that the	43
is what is	43
all you have	43
is not my	43
the people and	43
that these are	43
i had an	43
there you can	43
12 years old	43
with the internet	43
so i am	43
as we get	43
to decide whether	43
tried to do	43
very first time	43
we choose to	43
have to keep	43
we should not	43
should not be	43
how did you	43
the problems of	43
ahead of the	43
it back to	43
ill never forget	43
i invite you	43
or in a	43
is made of	43
the world can	43
the human mind	43
to have been	43
in the short	43
can do something	43
thats why the	43
better than that	43
and that you	43
it is really	43
its not so	43
where i am	43
youve probably heard	43
involved in the	43
large number of	43
they get a	43
are less likely	43
the capacity to	43
i was sitting	43
this might be	43
its like to	43
i didnt even	43
100 years ago	43
to find ways	43
we take a	43
we need it	43
have a great	43
it had been	43
so what about	43
its more than	43
that by the	43
we put them	43
so you might	43
know that this	43
may be the	43
there could be	43
told you about	43
as many as	43
as one of	43
to start by	43
and she goes	43
the birth of	43
me to my	43
to do i	43
to the rest	43
what they are	43
for so long	43
75 percent of	43
me what i	43
because you cant	43
to see in	43
for the very	43
together in a	43
really excited about	43
with the rest	43
to do my	43
you will not	43
heres the problem	43
we know we	43
of which are	43
all the rest	43
i could make	43
we do something	43
and it had	43
we seem to	43
how to use	43
and yet we	43
to solve a	43
of being able	43
they would be	43
the worlds largest	43
back at the	43
about how you	43
if it wasnt	43
two of the	43
i lost my	43
inside the brain	43
now and then	43
and i sat	43
it should have	43
out all the	43
i was to	43
we saw the	43
that you saw	43
of years and	43
to make their	43
in search of	43
lot of our	43
of work to	43
the one i	43
a source of	43
but then the	43
we find ourselves	43
came from the	43
down into the	43
growing up in	43
they all have	43
a new kind	43
how is this	43
10 times the	43
we were all	43
and that it	43
few years later	43
i spent a	43
if we get	43
to develop a	43
how do they	43
the desire to	43
back to us	43
go in and	43
so weve got	43
to happen in	43
and decided to	43
it was one	43
the world will	43
and women are	43
its really a	43
and i never	42
and it could	42
the next big	42
that there were	42
a guy named	42
mom and dad	42
for a week	42
every single year	42
response to the	42
not good enough	42
dont want you	42
for each of	42
go to work	42
but i hope	42
know whats going	42
so we wanted	42
the problem and	42
to talk a	42
it up to	42
of the major	42
there was nothing	42
amount of information	42
to apply the	42
us to think	42
so we said	42
up to you	42
known as a	42
new ways of	42
there is nothing	42
its a new	42
that this would	42
lot of ways	42
will need to	42
i remember the	42
that you want	42
back in time	42
as a country	42
in the house	42
a much larger	42
in the entire	42
beginning of this	42
to put the	42
so that people	42
to show up	42
are kind of	42
think there is	42
a different kind	42
the other is	42
in the afternoon	42
people are doing	42
question for you	42
on mars and	42
that its very	42
the next morning	42
thank you i	42
wait a minute	42
to need to	42
way to think	42
things you can	42
of it so	42
told you that	42
first day of	42
come to a	42
to predict the	42
piece of the	42
high levels of	42
are you a	42
and it took	42
women who are	42
image of a	42
in the home	42
it works in	42
of this talk	42
talk to the	42
the health of	42
of you is	42
its very simple	42
end of that	42
a great example	42
reason for that	42
we have made	42
the same with	42
to be used	42
he was like	42
if i want	42
spend most of	42
it wasnt the	42
these things that	42
understand how the	42
the building blocks	42
look at my	42
are very different	42
the world a	42
big enough to	42
of course this	42
but this time	42
so the way	42
who have a	42
right at the	42
is to use	42
machine learning is	42
a day and	42
doing this for	42
the great recession	42
to what i	42
back on the	42
to read and	42
that i showed	42
were more likely	42
talk about this	42
important part of	42
to a few	42
people all over	42
to speak about	42
whatever it takes	42
down to a	42
can tell us	42
how we do	42
and so im	42
ones and zeros	42
of the countries	42
to do everything	42
interested in this	42
going to share	42
find is that	42
but also to	42
decided to make	42
it was more	42
the other and	42
i do know	42
just like that	42
in the computer	42
been doing is	42
in mind that	42
this is whats	42
and we wanted	42
to this question	42
facial blood flow	42
in the night	42
in a study	42
i learned from	42
off to the	42
like a human	42
over the internet	42
and i always	42
to be good	42
do you feel	42
because thats the	42
see is the	42
but a lot	42
is there any	42
what the world	42
just give you	42
people can be	42
when we first	42
be used in	42
i can make	42
of what you	42
if you start	42
all those things	42
just a bunch	42
the time it	42
have had a	42
as if the	42
girls to be	42
find the right	42
that the way	42
you how to	42
we are today	42
couple of months	42
one and a	42
a line of	42
away from us	42
in the north	42
that when it	42
them and the	42
united states of	42
i was still	42
in the whole	42
the internet is	42
a hard time	42
have to trust	42
my whole life	42
a lot less	42
make it a	41
in the business	41
if you really	41
to say to	41
of a planet	41
of the middle	41
its a huge	41
but what you	41
we just dont	41
of each other	41
the story is	41
every year and	41
time in my	41
i do is	41
is a computer	41
youve got the	41
like to take	41
what might be	41
world this is	41
as i could	41
that even if	41
else in the	41
who are the	41
your life and	41
the height of	41
of the comet	41
a century ago	41
i didnt think	41
i noticed that	41
me it was	41
you for coming	41
the way back	41
tell the difference	41
of them will	41
so that when	41
a time of	41
as a function	41
important for us	41
stand up and	41
you all to	41
about a million	41
to take them	41
can imagine that	41
we may be	41
is what they	41
and im really	41
out there that	41
get the right	41
to get you	41
we do about	41
do they do	41
to identify the	41
be a great	41
in our country	41
we ought to	41
up if you	41
and turn it	41
im a little	41
how on earth	41
to the way	41
in three dimensions	41
of whats going	41
half an hour	41
about what they	41
same is true	41
and theres an	41
you for your	41
by way of	41
the gap between	41
of human history	41
here to talk	41
why i think	41
it is an	41
of you and	41
of the war	41
and that they	41
use of the	41
tell you this	41
where its going	41
but you also	41
if they can	41
an even more	41
fact that its	41
i started a	41
im showing you	41
places in the	41
the american public	41
seem like a	41
who are you	41
we started with	41
moment in time	41
very different than	41
is a question	41
you remember the	41
the brain in	41
goes back to	41
on and so	41
without having to	41
has become a	41
you could be	41
a situation where	41
and heres what	41
dont have time	41
we do the	41
to connect with	41
how much they	41
to be better	41
with a few	41
a very complex	41
to get people	41
and we say	41
more powerful than	41
turned out that	41
and what about	41
story about the	41
participate in the	41
of machine learning	41
and im just	41
it at the	41
it was amazing	41
in any way	41
wide variety of	41
at least i	41
certain kind of	41
i think these	41
standing in the	41
in the corner	41
so what happened	41
that they want	41
you start with	41
a year in	41
the subject of	41
the same is	41
mean that we	41
70 hours of	41
of the words	41
once upon a	41
theres something wrong	41
social media and	41
the key thing	41
the foundation of	41
to be aware	41
in the 90s	41
thats sort of	41
of this new	41
tell me how	41
far from the	41
than what we	41
you need is	41
been thinking about	41
i asked my	41
one more time	41
the promise of	41
to take on	41
so that is	41
a new era	41
of my colleagues	41
and i mean	41
point in the	41
information about the	41
away from this	41
of such a	41
lot of stuff	41
that means we	41
to make people	41
of life in	41
answer that question	41
figured out how	41
to change it	41
a lot and	41
a type of	41
working in the	41
not know what	41
makes us human	41
of the higgs	41
to see you	41
is for the	41
and i watched	41
to join the	41
me that he	41
the voices of	41
i said that	41
he was not	41
and then this	41
a place in	41
to better understand	41
they got to	41
and sure enough	41
so it seems	41
that allow us	41
theres something else	41
i felt the	41
the business of	41
can make the	41
more than two	41
that i made	41
a process of	41
at night and	41
so i get	41
in a second	41
important that we	41
if its a	41
that we did	41
to me about	41
with the other	41
to the sun	41
you just saw	41
arts and culture	41
i have learned	41
we would like	41
whats wrong with	41
that the universe	41
into the water	41
time we have	41
is in fact	41
to the us	41
and i met	41
that to the	41
to have some	41
for the whole	41
the past decade	41
that that was	41
have to really	41
my brother and	41
it makes sense	41
of science and	41
i knew it	41
then we will	40
and its about	40
lived in a	40
any of these	40
could have been	40
each other for	40
i tell them	40
then i would	40
you hear about	40
time thinking about	40
top of a	40
paying attention to	40
upon a time	40
new york to	40
dollars worth of	40
you just have	40
used in the	40
the incredible hulk	40
may have heard	40
when i hear	40
to come from	40
as if they	40
the war on	40
look at those	40
the world now	40
as we have	40
would you say	40
do what we	40
you dont even	40
the world from	40
work that we	40
the hubble space	40
and you think	40
reason why i	40
but it could	40
show you an	40
but when it	40
in the space	40
more of us	40
get to know	40
what it would	40
going into the	40
because it means	40
on this is	40
is when the	40
this is more	40
in the midst	40
a problem of	40
in the eye	40
but the fact	40
i will be	40
the early days	40
i can say	40
maybe you make	40
that you do	40
want to find	40
and then one	40
even the most	40
if i just	40
tell them that	40
the sistine chapel	40
we are still	40
the rational decision	40
the moment when	40
the gulf of	40
listening to a	40
time for us	40
to the one	40
but the point	40
what you find	40
weve had the	40
caught up in	40
of things to	40
you can still	40
put together a	40
i should have	40
to fight for	40
have to put	40
in the words	40
to keep us	40
few of the	40
maximize future freedom	40
you put it	40
somewhere in the	40
going on with	40
to build it	40
in your mind	40
theres a big	40
grew up with	40
a little less	40
the community and	40
the things you	40
have one of	40
they needed to	40
its a beautiful	40
we go back	40
most people think	40
and theyre all	40
about what happens	40
that have to	40
as important as	40
think of that	40
going to move	40
you name it	40
the mystery of	40
think a lot	40
so we know	40
opposed to the	40
with this idea	40
that i really	40
open your eyes	40
and its an	40
need to start	40
science and technology	40
waiting for the	40
get in the	40
also in the	40
at some of	40
that may be	40
not enough to	40
would be an	40
the world if	40
found in the	40
just as the	40
a wonderful thing	40
to move forward	40
what would that	40
small number of	40
its important that	40
to a group	40
those kinds of	40
percent increase in	40
no one is	40
going to a	40
back to our	40
be a lot	40
if you live	40
of how it	40
the midst of	40
the movement of	40
i could find	40
and make them	40
give it to	40
what makes us	40
from the earth	40
as we speak	40
and since then	40
we do and	40
me is that	40
such thing as	40
that way we	40
see the same	40
and how the	40
their lives and	40
of doing this	40
i was feeling	40
that had a	40
seems to have	40
have a solution	40
see behind me	40
because its the	40
using the same	40
in my work	40
in a country	40
with it and	40
kind of person	40
not trying to	40
all this stuff	40
its not something	40
the moment that	40
but theres no	40
a gene drive	40
is better than	40
made sure that	40
and the future	40
that were in	40
those who have	40
is to get	40
of our life	40
is how the	40
them back to	40
i have found	40
the population of	40
not part of	40
to be my	40
way down to	40
it was only	40
that im not	40
because i wanted	40
and none of	40
this stuff is	40
fact is that	40
we cant see	40
like this so	40
but you see	40
all of which	40
some people are	40
thanks very much	40
to you in	40
or something like	40
with our own	40
is where it	40
youre not a	40
states of america	40
my mother was	40
the challenge is	40
to say it	40
the very best	40
so forth and	40
the bad guys	40
to the table	40
thats a big	40
nine out of	40
and so these	40
of those are	40
be doing it	40
come into the	40
gives us the	40
let me start	40
when i see	40
to get more	40
we have more	40
have a really	40
it doesnt make	40
the world have	40
i could be	40
two years later	40
thinking about what	40
their own lives	40
came up to	40
of me and	40
amount of dark	40
in the area	40
then i thought	40
the topic of	40
to work at	40
less than half	40
we also need	40
a wide variety	40
at any given	40
is the largest	40
the story about	40
in science and	40
the mother of	40
with climate change	40
many people are	40
but theyre also	40
way of knowing	40
i understand that	40
are interested in	40
from the bottom	40
as if it	40
to allow us	40
to get my	40
our promise to	40
example of this	40
i did was	40
these guys are	39
they may not	39
the digital age	39
do this kind	39
is a small	39
problem with this	39
in the time	39
in different ways	39
of the matter	39
he was very	39
of the air	39
is really important	39
they know that	39
addition to the	39
but even more	39
on a computer	39
want to play	39
is because they	39
and they use	39
this ability to	39
the brain so	39
of this in	39
when you give	39
early in the	39
person who is	39
to test this	39
problems in the	39
out for a	39
its the only	39
interact with the	39
in the tropics	39
and its got	39
as we are	39
i think in	39
thats the only	39
you have all	39
was growing up	39
we wouldnt have	39
dont know where	39
more interested in	39
a half billion	39
time that i	39
to use this	39
but its the	39
should be the	39
i have one	39
be much more	39
part of me	39
able to go	39
way you can	39
can say that	39
none of them	39
the probability of	39
it doesnt take	39
of the network	39
hope is that	39
you find it	39
and so now	39
and over time	39
pick up the	39
im telling you	39
to tell them	39
i started looking	39
of the study	39
thats a real	39
and so many	39
i found this	39
really interested in	39
in the very	39
even though they	39
we are very	39
and its called	39
and it really	39
and some people	39
go through a	39
when i talk	39
at home in	39
comes to the	39
the worst thing	39
i say this	39
thats really important	39
here at the	39
going to keep	39
ive been talking	39
can use it	39
we created a	39
i think are	39
points of view	39
were doing in	39
you may think	39
to put this	39
the body and	39
and more people	39
but you get	39
this is me	39
of being a	39
the game is	39
have to see	39
what i have	39
and what the	39
we can then	39
spent the last	39
i wouldnt have	39
you find a	39
you can hear	39
case of the	39
want to spend	39
years as a	39
move away from	39
start thinking about	39
is about to	39
to your own	39
focused on the	39
as many people	39
about something that	39
sure that the	39
is in our	39
youre in the	39
think i was	39
is something we	39
and see how	39
the reason it	39
we know is	39
no one can	39
of life on	39
to remind you	39
at the speed	39
have a sense	39
is a long	39
i love my	39
have to figure	39
on planet earth	39
form of a	39
what did they	39
can get to	39
you begin to	39
and also the	39
much as i	39
meters per second	39
easy to see	39
and this would	39
the father of	39
i told her	39
to create something	39
a lack of	39
the minds of	39
that make up	39
to us in	39
other people who	39
a few times	39
heres one of	39
can it be	39
last year we	39
happens is that	39
we use this	39
i put it	39
a little boy	39
to this problem	39
gave rise to	39
present in the	39
the art of	39
also know that	39
get a sense	39
seems like a	39
at the last	39
is now the	39
thought this was	39
on a global	39
to speak up	39
the challenge that	39
feel like i	39
even if we	39
work with the	39
long way to	39
and you look	39
you still have	39
always wanted to	39
let me try	39
but i am	39
to make something	39
one in a	39
try to find	39
the founder of	39
have to understand	39
and people are	39
a box of	39
we can put	39
come home from	39
even want to	39
the night sky	39
its like the	39
get the same	39
means that you	39
but were going	39
to use these	39
the ways that	39
such a way	39
the point that	39
our minds and	39
so as you	39
and the number	39
i do this	39
going to continue	39
might think that	39
tells you that	39
of people to	39
and now the	39
we are and	39
that we found	39
also need to	39
there was another	39
and he told	39
knew how to	39
you can say	39
one thing you	39
somewhere along the	39
looking for the	39
and the one	39
to end with	39
reach out and	39
a good time	39
is this one	39
that i will	39
the spread of	39
this is like	39
likely to have	39
to put them	39
the mass of	39
looking at it	39
work in a	39
it was because	39
these were the	39
do with our	39
want to help	39
dont think thats	39
is to try	39
i will tell	39
on the spot	39
to what extent	39
of the different	39
in the absence	39
year or two	39
them out of	39
find ourselves in	39
it in their	39
do you really	39
a very nice	39
go into a	39
out of all	39
to have that	39
you can only	39
about what i	39
of the space	39
last 50 years	39
to be something	39
know what this	39
know this is	39
first is that	39
also known as	39
and youre going	39
that i couldnt	39
the next 20	39
like the one	39
in it and	39
for one of	39
happened to me	39
now we know	38
in the mind	38
the bitcoin blockchain	38
changed the way	38
the ability of	38
the world with	38
is the number	38
we could be	38
wife and i	38
then you see	38
so why is	38
you with a	38
he looked at	38
going on inside	38
the joy of	38
where all the	38
but theres another	38
imagine that we	38
are out there	38
that was my	38
area of the	38
are in a	38
are smarter than	38
that she had	38
going to call	38
lot of my	38
sitting next to	38
might just be	38
and see the	38
of hundreds of	38
time to do	38
see what was	38
better and better	38
similar to what	38
the best and	38
second thing that	38
getting to the	38
his or her	38
can i get	38
not saying that	38
so it turns	38
its not really	38
why do i	38
they can use	38
we are here	38
across the globe	38
than i am	38
we get this	38
wrong with this	38
so in order	38
in the open	38
thats the reason	38
going to stop	38
a product of	38
the animal kingdom	38
is the time	38
led to a	38
is the reason	38
dont give a	38
for all time	38
had a big	38
i did this	38
increase in the	38
i heard that	38
a button and	38
so thank you	38
trying to help	38
wanted to show	38
the reason im	38
the thing i	38
the function of	38
with my wife	38
and we really	38
the international community	38
are you ready	38
idea of how	38
enabled us to	38
it can make	38
a young woman	38
going to run	38
what you think	38
men in the	38
the arab region	38
into the system	38
and because the	38
to climate change	38
ive talked about	38
human beings are	38
not just because	38
it out in	38
it was written	38
will never be	38
the right side	38
a half a	38
they went to	38
and if were	38
soon as the	38
want to learn	38
make that happen	38
way that is	38
get a little	38
those things that	38
but as you	38
a certain kind	38
of artificial intelligence	38
especially in the	38
is not for	38
that i started	38
had to make	38
you put a	38
the guy who	38
and now were	38
couple of examples	38
imagine that you	38
ahead of us	38
when i go	38
is a different	38
voice in my	38
close your eyes	38
but instead of	38
this because i	38
the introduction of	38
very important for	38
it took a	38
to return to	38
i went out	38
to get away	38
face of the	38
us to get	38
to say this	38
should be a	38
will take us	38
a very early	38
story of a	38
ability to think	38
the important thing	38
like this in	38
it sort of	38
what it meant	38
with all this	38
can do about	38
not only are	38
youre able to	38
about what you	38
is because of	38
means we have	38
take you to	38
the best in	38
in your head	38
and looking at	38
base of the	38
the internet was	38
we think its	38
and what did	38
for so many	38
could not be	38
the physics of	38
was a real	38
if i didnt	38
if we didnt	38
you could get	38
is that every	38
reminds me of	38
so heres what	38
some people will	38
have to worry	38
in which they	38
how to build	38
of us do	38
this is amazing	38
on our own	38
family and friends	38
of fear and	38
hard to see	38
we have that	38
years ago the	38
could have a	38
those things are	38
i was talking	38
to slow down	38
you tell me	38
smarter and smarter	38
looks at the	38
we can move	38
you might find	38
it may not	38
didnt know that	38
there were two	38
are looking for	38
to run a	38
time to go	38
to be successful	38
so what weve	38
know that you	38
i can be	38
were going through	38
will always be	38
use the word	38
would argue that	38
just kind of	38
have got to	38
genes that are	38
when we take	38
when i think	38
it in your	38
doesnt have any	38
down in the	38
we are living	38
feel a little	38
a year or	38
around the time	38
trying to solve	38
been doing this	38
it is actually	38
they were so	38
got out of	38
see how the	38
who i was	38
so lets start	38
to build this	38
start to see	38
i have always	38
have to talk	38
than half of	38
the best part	38
and to get	38
that most people	38
back from the	38
of the book	38
you an idea	38
you can understand	38
lets see if	38
that when people	38
or some other	38
had never seen	38
you see there	38
of social media	38
it out and	38
you live in	38
know about this	38
i find it	38
they talked about	38
this was my	38
people with disabilities	38
and all i	38
story and i	38
and other people	38
sense of how	38
supposed to do	38
of this project	38
you have two	38
the reason we	38
how could we	38
into the lab	38
for a little	38
and what would	38
so what this	37
per square meter	37
what weve seen	37
for the entire	37
millions and millions	37
all in the	37
we can tell	37
to form a	37
of how much	37
but its still	37
right in front	37
so what did	37
i start to	37
thats why im	37
the financial crisis	37
few weeks later	37
this project is	37
where is the	37
with just a	37
the rights of	37
you guys are	37
way out of	37
the first was	37
there are over	37
and i took	37
in the 1990s	37
that leads to	37
on the site	37
that its the	37
the past six	37
a billion people	37
to improve the	37
used to do	37
faster and faster	37
the last three	37
is equivalent to	37
how about this	37
companies that are	37
are not supposed	37
almost all of	37
can hear the	37
a place called	37
to understand and	37
the safety of	37
based on their	37
and get a	37
a really bad	37
because we can	37
the time but	37
with a question	37
that is in	37
it has no	37
need a lot	37
as a community	37
when it came	37
by far the	37
continue to improve	37
and make sure	37
felt like a	37
on a planet	37
just the beginning	37
and each one	37
i cant do	37
function of the	37
some people say	37
order to do	37
trying to build	37
that needs to	37
that even though	37
have heard of	37
so you get	37
was the best	37
looking at is	37
getting out of	37
we see this	37
its possible to	37
to share a	37
but for a	37
a picture that	37
you to know	37
it was called	37
the worlds first	37
that gives you	37
of a man	37
i can show	37
would have thought	37
know that in	37
kinds of people	37
the short term	37
talk to each	37
that are very	37
difference between the	37
is one that	37
the war in	37
they came from	37
enough to get	37
world in the	37
or not they	37
we cant even	37
was asked to	37
more than anything	37
we end up	37
all the data	37
find that the	37
they really are	37
down at the	37
went to school	37
you get it	37
done a lot	37
are likely to	37
a woman who	37
something about this	37
hours of tv	37
but thats the	37
because of their	37
lot more than	37
to do for	37
of their time	37
less than two	37
and women who	37
the message that	37
pick up a	37
talking to the	37
of the oldest	37
in the top	37
which has been	37
see what the	37
is it going	37
now is that	37
our lives and	37
but we were	37
you must be	37
they can make	37
you find that	37
a young girl	37
as it was	37
see that its	37
allows me to	37
a very short	37
so i wanted	37
have their own	37
would be in	37
of light and	37
now we are	37
and he looked	37
thats just the	37
end of a	37
the same for	37
and they found	37
i talked about	37
its such a	37
understand how this	37
the street and	37
we had in	37
tell a story	37
to look after	37
and as soon	37
you didnt have	37
my personal favorite	37
in our bodies	37
go to sleep	37
the data that	37
the day after	37
in the opposite	37
go home and	37
where it was	37
thinking about that	37
at the level	37
youve got this	37
we started a	37
its just the	37
understand how to	37
in the family	37
the entire world	37
as a kind	37
for me i	37
does it do	37
the models are	37
what they can	37
there can be	37
of us were	37
people to be	37
one another and	37
i learned about	37
of last year	37
was a pretty	37
from the same	37
youre interested in	37
us all the	37
do it because	37
part of an	37
they come to	37
the island of	37
one thing to	37
you would think	37
year in the	37
that we cannot	37
at a distance	37
you just a	37
we set up	37
to put in	37
we start with	37
a human body	37
to match the	37
in which i	37
what youre saying	37
a very strong	37
a generation of	37
top of it	37
we got the	37
result of the	37
what we had	37
several years ago	37
what i can	37
i think theyre	37
its not easy	37
people that i	37
it we can	37
out at the	37
and every single	37
when they do	37
that has the	37
you can learn	37
we should all	37
means you can	37
to get better	37
ive shown you	37
about is the	37
so for instance	37
see how they	37
this is it	37
stay in the	37
time for the	37
i discovered that	37
the front lines	37
to grow up	37
the strength of	37
to get all	37
it was pretty	37
been on the	37
they did it	37
you talk about	37
and i became	37
important to remember	37
billions of people	37
in most of	37
so those are	37
more than 10	37
a way thats	37
can do to	37
when we go	37
to the streets	37
the right is	37
of all that	37
playing around with	37
change the climate	37
a tremendous amount	37
to school and	37
not a part	37
do that and	37
years old i	37
remind us of	37
that the best	37
a solution to	37
that the next	37
is still a	37
know where to	37
many people have	37
give you one	37
by their own	37
to take us	37
that led to	37
me and the	37
us out of	37
interested in doing	37
i didnt get	37
it is important	36
of all time	36
something we can	36
had the same	36
many different ways	36
of us will	36
of my country	36
at least the	36
question to ask	36
which is probably	36
a few thousand	36
still have a	36
more of them	36
i have some	36
when it gets	36
can you tell	36
just one of	36
thats where we	36
i also think	36
in the meantime	36
of the answer	36
you really want	36
might have a	36
because we need	36
robots like this	36
want to focus	36
you might ask	36
that is more	36
they found that	36
wanted to say	36
lots of things	36
and even more	36
have to stay	36
we could take	36
see that it	36
its a way	36
the long run	36
the era of	36
only thing i	36
thought of as	36
together in the	36
that and i	36
i worked on	36
wait for the	36
in case you	36
contribute to the	36
up with my	36
but theyre not	36
happens in the	36
is the real	36
some years ago	36
because it doesnt	36
but thats a	36
come back and	36
were not in	36
we can bring	36
any of this	36
there was the	36
the basic idea	36
you that i	36
talk about is	36
lot of that	36
and it still	36
the brain to	36
look at their	36
we can connect	36
what i thought	36
can help us	36
its just not	36
is the result	36
then you get	36
the hearts and	36
on earth and	36
times as much	36
do it is	36
way back to	36
this little bump	36
give them the	36
from the perspective	36
it came to	36
answer to this	36
behind the wheel	36
tell me what	36
long time and	36
in american history	36
an epic win	36
a little too	36
we see is	36
her name is	36
you want a	36
build machines that	36
what youre going	36
a real problem	36
we made a	36
put it back	36
when i had	36
i told the	36
that the more	36
with you a	36
they are now	36
of them would	36
of the women	36
was no way	36
but its actually	36
during the first	36
also have a	36
going on and	36
me back to	36
what i had	36
the stock market	36
people from all	36
im looking for	36
and we go	36
to run the	36
me talk about	36
in the southern	36
to how we	36
she told me	36
theyre a little	36
they come from	36
there are several	36
and it takes	36
years in the	36
in this new	36
can still be	36
is the last	36
when they go	36
from new york	36
in part because	36
of the 19th	36
for me and	36
the really interesting	36
the belief that	36
machines that are	36
youd like to	36
think of what	36
about the power	36
all of it	36
and then maybe	36
is a world	36
dont do it	36
the question i	36
do i do	36
is used to	36
based on this	36
be the best	36
to get an	36
that in this	36
the moon and	36
of the early	36
tell you why	36
you that we	36
lot of information	36
to learn and	36
found myself in	36
are no longer	36
we will build	36
on the line	36
it to my	36
ran out of	36
you back to	36
we are using	36
three dimensions of	36
much as the	36
the most dangerous	36
make up the	36
you can create	36
bit of an	36
to the best	36
is the right	36
its true that	36
know who you	36
decided to go	36
the morning and	36
we will need	36
and start to	36
the us military	36
you do the	36
together as a	36
the plant is	36
deal with that	36
bit of the	36
to sit on	36
on the verge	36
this thing called	36
to take over	36
less than 10	36
this for the	36
have to try	36
of a global	36
on a scale	36
they were more	36
why does this	36
but there were	36
young people who	36
math and science	36
you cant make	36
to work hard	36
all right so	36
you if you	36
of what im	36
in a g	36
do now is	36
then the next	36
across the street	36
talking about a	36
and he goes	36
whos going to	36
it can do	36
our daily lives	36
be at the	36
at the start	36
dont even have	36
when i did	36
and to see	36
and they could	36
and more importantly	36
we just had	36
throughout the world	36
with my family	36
its very easy	36
you out there	36
and more than	36
two percent of	36
was diagnosed with	36
id love to	36
can see is	36
was the last	36
and more and	36
another thing that	36
was pretty much	36
world of the	36
figure out a	36
than we do	36
the opposite direction	36
as it goes	36
is to do	36
about it i	36
was the same	36
do the right	36
for your attention	36
to what you	36
out of you	36
the same amount	36
as if you	36
man on the	36
to become the	36
gives you the	36
this to the	36
a very specific	36
it possible to	36
that so many	36
and you just	36
things that they	36
found that it	36
how does the	36
a video of	36
doesnt make any	36
what we should	36
do what you	36
its a wonderful	36
do if you	36
the ocean is	36
but what it	36
was starting to	36
on a date	36
so they are	36
in this video	36
us from the	36
quite the opposite	36
if they could	36
work together to	36
good for us	36
its also the	36
is the very	36
it was made	36
of the main	36
to change your	36
the problem that	36
because it makes	36
wanted to find	36
you in a	36
turned into a	36
of information that	36
the most recent	36
they dont really	36
all kind of	36
we get older	36
the panama papers	36
or do you	36
very few people	36
tried to get	35
get it to	35
i know it	35
its used to	35
that is true	35
to trust the	35
not very good	35
a red tomato	35
we also know	35
like in a	35
fact that it	35
the moment we	35
do they have	35
you see behind	35
it looked like	35
few of us	35
of them had	35
been going on	35
he went to	35
the details of	35
if you work	35
and the good	35
so that he	35
students and i	35
do it the	35
you can read	35
may have seen	35
just in time	35
went through the	35
give us the	35
by people who	35
on the wall	35
seven and a	35
precision public health	35
have a huge	35
because she was	35
the smell of	35
we all want	35
and she says	35
about being a	35
we are working	35
good at this	35
may have been	35
show you is	35
to the south	35
been used to	35
at the back	35
of people from	35
know there are	35
how were going	35
that its really	35
took me to	35
the house and	35
couple of things	35
answer is no	35
than there are	35
but i knew	35
that i believe	35
called it the	35
and here you	35
me a lot	35
in so many	35
and heres a	35
on a very	35
the roof of	35
i came across	35
would be like	35
who has a	35
i was growing	35
what people are	35
you have seen	35
it will make	35
were a little	35
we were very	35
25 years ago	35
to say about	35
the places where	35
in a really	35
to do as	35
have a way	35
i just think	35
and so were	35
to be treated	35
it in my	35
a system of	35
they can go	35
have to come	35
what is that	35
you know where	35
to be kind	35
is that most	35
no longer a	35
hear a lot	35
i happened to	35
in the head	35
and the internet	35
is because the	35
i came out	35
i could tell	35
different than the	35
and maybe even	35
how could i	35
the fact of	35
i say that	35
models are skillful	35
and you put	35
when there is	35
and even when	35
learned is that	35
how much do	35
terms of how	35
for me it	35
take responsibility for	35
you think is	35
it might look	35
way of life	35
the middle and	35
to protect our	35
the lab and	35
here is an	35
to get their	35
a very difficult	35
have an impact	35
from a single	35
live like this	35
people to do	35
have a conversation	35
and it didnt	35
show you now	35
make it more	35
and want to	35
what i saw	35
you know why	35
across the united	35
in time to	35
my students and	35
i am in	35
with thousands of	35
is the key	35
the story that	35
my life it	35
its on the	35
so thats one	35
something as simple	35
the loss of	35
you go from	35
come up to	35
hang on to	35
how does that	35
theres a real	35
of the real	35
the countries that	35
and do the	35
to bring it	35
go for a	35
a great idea	35
in and they	35
was to be	35
something a little	35
to spend the	35
got to know	35
bits and pieces	35
great deal of	35
they decided to	35
and you go	35
i was walking	35
of people with	35
thought to be	35
now were going	35
its no longer	35
there were some	35
be when you	35
of these new	35
and he wrote	35
but the more	35
do the math	35
in that case	35
aspect of this	35
deal with this	35
what he was	35
that instead of	35
is very different	35
not something that	35
that we may	35
well have a	35
the next five	35
second world war	35
the dna of	35
have to solve	35
show you two	35
company in the	35
with respect to	35
few weeks ago	35
was no longer	35
is how i	35
do it so	35
he was doing	35
an impact on	35
i took my	35
they were very	35
you dont understand	35
fact that this	35
have to fight	35
what happens with	35
if we continue	35
about other people	35
she was born	35
it goes up	35
some examples of	35
a completely new	35
show you one	35
you happen to	35
can actually see	35
is a bad	35
many people here	35
grades and scores	35
it really does	35
so in other	35
were at the	35
of paper and	35
of them i	35
so we got	35
take into account	35
knew that the	35
in my opinion	35
as young as	35
we saw a	35
are sort of	35
i was young	35
since that time	35
of the pyramid	35
the next level	35
told us that	35
they are doing	35
that the most	35
the people you	35
we can talk	35
we go through	35
and if there	35
any of those	35
not one of	35
and we hope	35
life on mars	35
but they didnt	35
no one else	35
something that has	35
and he is	35
and get the	35
thing we can	35
the next question	35
can be found	35
was the end	35
could look at	35
model of the	35
now i want	35
a great way	35
the light of	35
you listen to	35
than they were	35
more complicated than	35
in the game	35
answer to the	35
was a good	35
much of what	35
asked this question	35
have had to	35
woman in the	35
at the first	35
the moment of	35
right into the	35
theres a little	35
but what do	35
ago when i	35
the length of	35
and what happens	35
talking about this	35
lets go to	35
wrote a book	35
were doing this	35
we can begin	35
which we have	35
every aspect of	35
we might have	35
so when the	35
to find some	35
and i gave	35
too much time	35
up all the	35
the ways we	35
i can hear	35
can we make	35
to watch the	35
to come in	35
that when a	35
had never been	35
us to have	35
in a couple	35
social justice comedy	35
people living in	35
we also found	35
what we could	35
in this situation	35
in my lifetime	35
like this you	35
the same things	35
tell you is	35
can think about	35
the information that	35
wanted to give	35
problem that we	35
these are things	35
to get your	35
i like that	35
the real hum	35
that are so	35
our universe is	35
do i think	35
in and i	35
and when this	35
the flow of	35
i like this	35
other kinds of	35
in the bahamas	35
and in those	35
you go into	35
seven years old	35
spend more time	35
last two years	35
over here and	35
had to find	35
theres plenty of	35
you can even	35
looked like a	35
when i found	35
see that theres	35
youre about to	35
just as we	35
as you might	34
up as a	34
if it doesnt	34
no access to	34
to me but	34
the single most	34
periods of time	34
its not very	34
call it a	34
when that happens	34
the fall of	34
that its actually	34
compare it to	34
doesnt have the	34
like so many	34
the walls of	34
make a living	34
to be different	34
and part of	34
thought that the	34
i use the	34
will show you	34
next to each	34
that with a	34
the first hour	34
we make it	34
fraction of a	34
the system and	34
of our brain	34
to me as	34
a certain amount	34
which is where	34
one way or	34
perhaps the most	34
and it becomes	34
how we see	34
tremendous amount of	34
of which is	34
to the beginning	34
to contribute to	34
first year of	34
the very beginning	34
many people who	34
i should be	34
and about the	34
of life that	34
by doing that	34
women and children	34
it was hard	34
of what were	34
that was just	34
that every time	34
i still have	34
to our own	34
is an image	34
to do next	34
is essentially a	34
and do you	34
and they cant	34
wrong with me	34
because at the	34
think thats going	34
age of the	34
got to work	34
i need you	34
the main thing	34
because it turns	34
use it for	34
there were many	34
us in this	34
believe that they	34
not only did	34
what they call	34
over time so	34
do i want	34
so much time	34
of as a	34
seven years ago	34
said to her	34
we do our	34
get it right	34
the old days	34
but its really	34
can also see	34
to meet the	34
of the physical	34
and she is	34
right on the	34
we got there	34
theyre more likely	34
im in the	34
after world war	34
i might be	34
like that but	34
the left and	34
the answers to	34
first hour of	34
when they have	34
for millions of	34
question of whether	34
this and i	34
some point in	34
that it had	34
if you need	34
how did it	34
and its actually	34
about today is	34
that he didnt	34
in my office	34
for many of	34
i can only	34
not to do	34
ive told you	34
we could make	34
is my favorite	34
at risk of	34
kind of an	34
dont like the	34
they came up	34
i wish id	34
to go with	34
that we saw	34
it cant be	34
of the political	34
do something like	34
economic and political	34
you how many	34
must be a	34
an effort to	34
me that it	34
answer is that	34
and ive got	34
one at the	34
interesting to me	34
behavior of the	34
actually have a	34
thousand years ago	34
what happened in	34
to the most	34
it will not	34
little bit better	34
so heres an	34
there are very	34
a word that	34
the air and	34
you that you	34
the tools that	34
first person to	34
learn from them	34
it was quite	34
get away with	34
dont have access	34
aspects of our	34
come to me	34
its not all	34
over the long	34
in some places	34
come to believe	34
of the right	34
is a key	34
how to read	34
depending on how	34
and it does	34
to keep them	34
colleague of mine	34
now is to	34
was also the	34
be nice to	34
so a few	34
and its all	34
the principles of	34
the museum of	34
who live in	34
looked like this	34
from the inside	34
that that is	34
so i came	34
went down to	34
its difficult to	34
in the public	34
the game of	34
bring it back	34
from the first	34
where were you	34
go up and	34
and this makes	34
time in a	34
put in the	34
you kind of	34
with us and	34
send it to	34
it meant to	34
in the event	34
someone who has	34
because i knew	34
i would get	34
going to think	34
want to end	34
didnt know how	34
to ask is	34
out of time	34
to the question	34
science and engineering	34
people out there	34
they could do	34
things go wrong	34
with my own	34
all the answers	34
do all of	34
by the state	34
that is now	34
the causes of	34
because you are	34
always going to	34
she has a	34
to play the	34
with the most	34
a study of	34
like we are	34
i learned to	34
we had been	34
and found that	34
the people we	34
front of your	34
tip of the	34
the world were	34
we spend a	34
of a young	34
i went down	34
is the thing	34
what that is	34
the world through	34
it was for	34
and it turned	34
home from work	34
we were told	34
the dalai lama	34
how we are	34
as we did	34
those that are	34
many people in	34
and we must	34
is the brain	34
to us by	34
is important for	34
into the ocean	34
seeing here is	34
its only by	34
on how we	34
that we now	34
are made of	34
of life is	34
much thank you	34
cells in the	34
and what im	34
and no matter	34
an average of	34
gulf of mexico	34
what we would	34
for five years	34
he said he	34
lives in the	34
so you go	34
of the european	34
the principle of	34
it its a	34
as we could	34
their way to	34
about it for	34
and not a	34
of a little	34
was a man	34
to keep in	34
whole series of	34
step out of	34
the map of	34
thirds of the	34
can go on	34
he was right	34
i could never	34
comes down to	34
girls and women	34
to happen to	34
it a lot	34
even more important	34
try to imagine	34
bit like the	34
can you see	34
and its important	34
people at the	34
couple years ago	34
the cold war	34
how did that	34
they are very	34
change your perspective	34
and then what	34
what its doing	34
and what does	34
two days later	34
one thing we	34
be used as	34
that even the	34
relationship between the	34
can talk to	34
then we get	34
the climate crisis	34
as you all	34
of us is	34
of the technology	34
if all of	34
system that is	34
they thought that	34
and i heard	34
in a universe	34
depending on the	34
what we now	34
was telling me	34
they have an	34
from a very	34
fraction of the	34
can use that	34
to fix it	34
because im a	34
lies in the	34
if we really	34
a very similar	34
a whole series	34
many years ago	34
we were just	34
the image of	34
learn a lot	34
a tool that	34
is where i	34
will be in	34
at it from	34
sit down and	34
role in the	34
the turing test	34
nine years old	34
of our most	34
to get up	34
the definition of	34
were at a	34
a guy called	34
do not know	34
has led to	34
the spirit of	34
whats called a	34
and it just	34
has a little	34
going up and	34
theres a problem	34
good or bad	34
there are also	34
to take responsibility	34
is you can	34
what you get	34
theres no reason	34
in the years	34
but in order	34
the outside of	33
could make a	33
like we do	33
but i couldnt	33
that we take	33
know each other	33
them into a	33
are hundreds of	33
was a time	33
when the earth	33
that will make	33
what im talking	33
work at the	33
trying to create	33
to cope with	33
i walked into	33
now you may	33
and by doing	33
see if it	33
and it got	33
china and india	33
on the order	33
energy in the	33
to live on	33
are all of	33
you also have	33
lo and behold	33
in a year	33
where i think	33
to read the	33
to change their	33
a half minutes	33
out of five	33
and its only	33
let me be	33
on the contrary	33
about what is	33
with intellectual disabilities	33
two kinds of	33
that i wasnt	33
of the system	33
which means you	33
the first two	33
in a particular	33
of my family	33
is to look	33
he did not	33
little bit different	33
it made me	33
to break the	33
really is a	33
the biggest problem	33
would you want	33
and just a	33
apply it to	33
energy from the	33
was like a	33
go all the	33
have something to	33
them is that	33
they care about	33
interesting thing about	33
when we started	33
its a pretty	33
im sure many	33
know what happens	33
if youve got	33
and im still	33
i felt that	33
to the new	33
you are all	33
in there and	33
aware of this	33
greenhouse gas emissions	33
and the body	33
talked about how	33
reason for this	33
that theyre not	33
bit more than	33
likely to get	33
to really understand	33
of doing that	33
happen to me	33
and hundreds of	33
the range of	33
the members of	33
the verge of	33
has been in	33
when you add	33
appears to be	33
there is to	33
to the global	33
theres a great	33
the results of	33
but they do	33
to work out	33
nobel prize for	33
take out your	33
we are on	33
part of you	33
people dont know	33
we hope to	33
whatever you want	33
at the expense	33
and you may	33
the impression that	33
know where the	33
that type of	33
the second world	33
of a person	33
thats because the	33
wouldnt be able	33
you get an	33
a collection of	33
of you that	33
as if we	33
earth is the	33
back to life	33
every day to	33
that they do	33
to write about	33
we tell them	33
to be quite	33
a really great	33
there are hundreds	33
into something that	33
of that and	33
at any time	33
this and this	33
to make more	33
a small country	33
other one is	33
some parts of	33
is filled with	33
problem in the	33
thanks so much	33
wouldnt have been	33
they are so	33
of the species	33
from the star	33
make it so	33
we put a	33
10 years of	33
goes into the	33
like to make	33
of the men	33
can only be	33
could take a	33
that i cant	33
but also in	33
theres all kinds	33
we made it	33
she looked at	33
put them into	33
you as a	33
friends of mine	33
people in a	33
a factor of	33
they can tell	33
to go after	33
back to it	33
some of your	33
in a city	33
in the 70s	33
to kill the	33
want to buy	33
where is it	33
do this we	33
inspired by the	33
learn more about	33
to the international	33
me that the	33
and so she	33
a young age	33
really easy to	33
realized that there	33
here is to	33
and a couple	33
learn about the	33
how can it	33
two million years	33
the solar wind	33
i cant help	33
the top and	33
began to think	33
and it looks	33
you today is	33
the high school	33
i realize that	33
see all the	33
we feel that	33
billion dollars in	33
to the idea	33
how they work	33
is just an	33
show of hands	33
we know this	33
at the edge	33
you today about	33
in many countries	33
about climate change	33
we cant do	33
it and you	33
to be living	33
with a single	33
we saw that	33
and here are	33
you at the	33
he was born	33
quite a few	33
years or so	33
know what that	33
and give them	33
when you try	33
this number is	33
never be able	33
the expense of	33
to face the	33
not the way	33
for the men	33
but im also	33
that with the	33
of the road	33
need to work	33
use a lot	33
to feel that	33
they might have	33
is an amazing	33
in doing so	33
me so much	33
at least as	33
led us to	33
on the map	33
from the world	33
the summer of	33
that can actually	33
is an idea	33
the challenges that	33
all i had	33
in the spinal	33
ability to understand	33
is to go	33
around us and	33
so think about	33
of the kids	33
and it might	33
are choosing to	33
it also means	33
place to be	33
higher risk of	33
of your head	33
was working on	33
to see and	33
people from the	33
i made it	33
me so i	33
that was actually	33
of women who	33
it runs on	33
for 30 years	33
said that they	33
a much better	33
comes back to	33
and tell me	33
the realm of	33
i set out	33
idea that you	33
so were not	33
your cell phone	33
i happen to	33
has all the	33
in the economy	33
that we put	33
have to live	33
believe that this	33
is the stuff	33
every time they	33
do right now	33
stars in the	33
in the animal	33
six years old	33
in this is	33
much like the	33
hope for the	33
of us would	33
it right now	33
as a human	33
is capable of	33
i was amazed	33
we deal with	33
using this technology	33
i took the	33
should be doing	33
came to my	33
the human race	33
and from the	33
you when you	33
so i ask	33
the human species	33
it goes back	33
to become an	33
a very high	33
youre seeing here	33
the sun and	33
ask you a	33
from the united	33
know about it	33
when we find	33
then i realized	33
we are seeing	33
thought about this	33
begin to see	33
is a better	33
i held on	33
that people dont	33
hearts and minds	33
it means you	33
much greater than	33
it was at	33
when i heard	33
in the 80s	33
did it in	33
in the deep	33
their loved ones	33
to see them	33
and let them	33
in the workplace	33
you got to	33
and on and	33
i was saying	33
of the end	33
next 20 years	33
with this is	33
the notion of	33
amount of energy	33
looks like in	33
out of school	33
of our society	33
so i took	33
little piece of	33
you do when	33
so then i	33
that i knew	32
takes a lot	32
up and said	32
able to learn	32
all at once	32
grow up to	32
to answer the	32
teach them to	32
is one thing	32
why are there	32
going to describe	32
and they told	32
doing something that	32
will be more	32
as a neuroscientist	32
to where we	32
of the process	32
that none of	32
have been working	32
i am still	32
to the lab	32
think in the	32
you have in	32
you have it	32
all this is	32
like you and	32
a bank account	32
would need to	32
falling in love	32
that we really	32
times a second	32
and im thinking	32
to it and	32
do it we	32
bhutan for life	32
to imagine how	32
into the air	32
talked about it	32
just as important	32
you come back	32
do is take	32
of us here	32
makes a difference	32
ones that are	32
in our galaxy	32
the combination of	32
us we have	32
i started with	32
bit about how	32
do it i	32
im doing now	32
now its a	32
of it i	32
i did i	32
you put them	32
is different than	32
is the following	32
in other countries	32
of ways to	32
the computer and	32
with a friend	32
criminal justice system	32
here on this	32
first part of	32
out that there	32
have a better	32
do believe that	32
we have developed	32
inside of it	32
about it but	32
is hard to	32
which is also	32
the way across	32
where i can	32
access to a	32
my lab is	32
them we have	32
lets face it	32
could also be	32
that happens to	32
out what the	32
about it so	32
to believe it	32
do with a	32
of what was	32
the first three	32
whats called the	32
because they cant	32
out of an	32
he would say	32
become part of	32
its a real	32
quality of the	32
of the key	32
able to create	32
who were dealing	32
rule of law	32
are full of	32
was also a	32
the ancient greeks	32
of the energy	32
a certain way	32
more of these	32
we all are	32
and it made	32
agree with me	32
rate at which	32
hands of the	32
from here to	32
there were only	32
when we did	32
like to ask	32
in the bottom	32
works in the	32
if they are	32
result of a	32
theres one thing	32
what would i	32
make a decision	32
compared to what	32
huge amounts of	32
are the kinds	32
i just got	32
my friends and	32
do better than	32
use it in	32
is a set	32
i turned to	32
off of the	32
to solve problems	32
idea is to	32
of the forest	32
i was seven	32
when all of	32
the chemistry of	32
and to my	32
of them that	32
in our pockets	32
of course not	32
than you would	32
i know the	32
the computer can	32
that youre a	32
you think it	32
been looking at	32
we can help	32
dont have an	32
to put that	32
to choose between	32
get us to	32
but in my	32
so whats going	32
am not a	32
new way to	32
we have found	32
this is interesting	32
of the ancient	32
we look for	32
and not in	32
to accept the	32
that they didnt	32
in the 1980s	32
today is that	32
where there was	32
more than 50	32
started to be	32
even if they	32
for many people	32
looking at me	32
of us that	32
so now the	32
the same age	32
the gift of	32
there are the	32
our own planet	32
but by the	32
long period of	32
in the bathroom	32
in the great	32
well this is	32
do we see	32
get all the	32
enhance a human	32
just think of	32
i was invited	32
i first saw	32
so much to	32
reach out to	32
because theres a	32
will happen to	32
you may know	32
going to grow	32
reality of the	32
in the evening	32
on and i	32
smarter than you	32
that you were	32
never heard of	32
arent going to	32
and we call	32
for her to	32
you to go	32
that should be	32
not need to	32
and we looked	32
bit about the	32
extent to which	32
is the work	32
we use our	32
it would work	32
the act of	32
number of years	32
in the sea	32
and that really	32
so we created	32
they are all	32
tell us a	32
like this its	32
people will be	32
dont know i	32
of the week	32
had to face	32
landed on the	32
to be involved	32
think thats the	32
the grand canyon	32
did not want	32
instead of a	32
same amount of	32
one in the	32
in this environment	32
one more thing	32
with this one	32
the world they	32
a half ago	32
small amount of	32
me to a	32
a project that	32
political and economic	32
into one of	32
anything you want	32
most of their	32
then i got	32
the civil rights	32
are beginning to	32
by the people	32
a new species	32
that over the	32
people talk about	32
new ways to	32
through all of	32
you what it	32
youre supposed to	32
design of the	32
is that he	32
of my brain	32
have been very	32
the secret to	32
once we have	32
the rate at	32
nest maintenance workers	32
think its the	32
to give this	32
take you on	32
from my own	32
they do so	32
in this game	32
talk to people	32
at one of	32
i dont just	32
you and your	32
are connected to	32
we know of	32
going to save	32
it could also	32
the next decade	32
of that plant	32
the spectrum of	32
to create new	32
easy and fun	32
on the inside	32
the same place	32
build a better	32
to say the	32
a half hours	32
and i tried	32
five million people	32
you believe in	32
than it was	32
as we think	32
so when youre	32
better than a	32
imagine a world	32
they tell us	32
to see an	32
we can work	32
to make and	32
that of the	32
there you go	32
and thats actually	32
lying on the	32
is essential to	32
up to our	32
as a little	32
for them and	32
what would be	32
the inside of	32
and i actually	32
that which is	32
to be and	32
to enhance a	32
hard to understand	32
really going on	32
look like if	32
can go back	32
85 percent of	32
the invention of	32
but here is	32
these things have	32
and find out	32
an attempt to	32
they took the	32
to say is	32
it and if	32
that seems to	32
was there to	32
some of his	32
this all the	32
you make it	32
we didnt get	32
is that what	32
the questions that	32
my mom was	32
the conclusion that	32
the way people	32
going to allow	32
we can just	32
they must be	32
you dont do	32
the data from	32
think of your	32
know exactly what	32
for one another	32
to be free	32
me if i	32
dont think its	32
every kind of	32
you go on	32
the most vulnerable	32
have never seen	32
four percent of	32
you must have	32
on the door	32
the one in	32
that we love	32
what most people	32
we have so	32
see from the	32
and hard to	32
we may not	32
we were not	32
to win this	32
to end up	32
the room and	32
want to create	32
us to understand	32
a thousand times	32
think back to	32
go around the	32
is the story	32
to recognize and	32
the magnitude of	32
dont understand why	32
wed have to	32
the day before	32
and one that	32
of things we	32
people out of	32
you this is	32
you might see	32
have heard about	32
went out to	32
changing the way	32
you a couple	32
we see entropica	32
her she was	32
where we dont	32
it did not	32
here are a	32
had the courage	32
we were at	32
exactly what the	32
you i have	32
that if youre	32
like all of	32
so lets take	32
a ton of	32
all life on	32
rich and poor	32
to answer that	32
learn from this	32
of the reason	32
because what we	32
than one percent	32
going to land	32
end of my	32
from the ocean	32
the genes that	32
that a few	32
a recent study	32
some of this	32
do it on	32
very much thank	32
need to figure	31
when we looked	31
a black hole	31
right now to	31
you were born	31
in the oceans	31
in on the	31
allow me to	31
now look at	31
with you and	31
decided to write	31
see how it	31
because we think	31
and i worked	31
they tried to	31
will never forget	31
now know that	31
the types of	31
because the people	31
do this and	31
think is a	31
us to take	31
quickly as possible	31
and at this	31
the dawn of	31
what i am	31
of the 21st	31
they do is	31
and it starts	31
people that have	31
and what he	31
have ever been	31
i decided i	31
first and foremost	31
and i guess	31
back in and	31
i want them	31
a personal level	31
three to four	31
to the middle	31
idea was to	31
and all this	31
need you to	31
new form of	31
a population of	31
want us to	31
going to write	31
instead of just	31
are actually going	31
when they come	31
as a woman	31
in a long	31
of course there	31
to minimize the	31
that have no	31
a company called	31
make an effort	31
into the city	31
do is they	31
of thinking and	31
i asked her	31
is the sound	31
to remove the	31
need to learn	31
each other that	31
think if you	31
to us that	31
telling me that	31
integrated into the	31
the road to	31
quit my job	31
friends and colleagues	31
with this kind	31
so rather than	31
tiny bit of	31
this guy is	31
thats part of	31
to understand this	31
our world is	31
said to him	31
they were trying	31
i like the	31
30 years of	31
the internet of	31
if its not	31
it i was	31
as to why	31
its also going	31
we have got	31
we asked ourselves	31
how they were	31
where i could	31
theres a certain	31
to take action	31
i got in	31
what were really	31
just looked at	31
to 50 percent	31
did in the	31
not have been	31
and what ive	31
to notice that	31
got back to	31
that id like	31
have the opportunity	31
off the shelf	31
the us is	31
as a consequence	31
dont think this	31
on the stage	31
predict the future	31
had just been	31
look back and	31
that makes the	31
same thing with	31
for four years	31
or not we	31
and a bunch	31
young people to	31
we can still	31
theory of evolution	31
we get from	31
the same so	31
do about this	31
a slightly different	31
do we need	31
we asked people	31
that did not	31
turn on the	31
we take for	31
what happened with	31
do not need	31
begin with a	31
just to show	31
i just thought	31
same time that	31
these things and	31
it in fact	31
it has all	31
person in this	31
and the man	31
our brains are	31
had been working	31
to hear about	31
children who are	31
of the screen	31
have a long	31
the world you	31
the feeling of	31
doing it for	31
do know is	31
did a study	31
places that we	31
four oclock in	31
it but i	31
we all see	31
a better place	31
which is this	31
a graduate student	31
is even more	31
of all kinds	31
the same and	31
how we feel	31
it is going	31
born in the	31
of making a	31
are not a	31
the eye and	31
in the soil	31
greater than the	31
thought that this	31
an answer to	31
a sheet of	31
in your hand	31
and theres nothing	31
you can download	31
rise to the	31
world and they	31
the names of	31
place to start	31
beginning of a	31
we say that	31
a new type	31
certain amount of	31
that were trying	31
walks of life	31
reason that i	31
started to look	31
and then my	31
with that in	31
the time for	31
years ago that	31
i think most	31
it possible for	31
we were talking	31
of this and	31
investing in the	31
sorts of other	31
i was being	31
and i and	31
figure out if	31
here and there	31
one part of	31
you and the	31
its quite a	31
play a little	31
we developed a	31
the body of	31
to get back	31
to teach them	31
the way and	31
to tell a	31
now what i	31
is the worlds	31
those people are	31
better way to	31
a phone call	31
was the beginning	31
you to look	31
there are different	31
and its so	31
go in the	31
make it to	31
to the bathroom	31
to us to	31
changes over time	31
solving for x	31
be surprised to	31
of this country	31
are now in	31
so here is	31
then one day	31
to do when	31
just a small	31
put them together	31
thousands of miles	31
million dollars to	31
the answer was	31
something which is	31
do that i	31
with things like	31
much better than	31
something in the	31
about 20 years	31
the days when	31
not to have	31
had already been	31
of the moon	31
united states has	31
is because its	31
one thing in	31
we have come	31
i didnt see	31
us at the	31
the right place	31
is exactly the	31
is the future	31
and your brain	31
going to send	31
do that by	31
soon as we	31
tried to make	31
the night before	31
we work with	31
go back in	31
have to choose	31
want to thank	31
know more about	31
we asked the	31
bit more about	31
weve got this	31
that are coming	31
knew it was	31
the milky way	31
to the whole	31
we build a	31
more than 30	31
so i like	31
other than the	31
will choose to	31
a threat to	31
and i wonder	31
be free to	31
not the first	31
and thats that	31
to my parents	31
thats not really	31
i picked up	31
life and i	31
has its own	31
in the stratosphere	31
theres nothing to	31
you through the	31
remind us that	31
is when we	31
larger than the	31
have gone through	31
is this the	31
an area of	31
then you will	31
it came from	31
that they couldnt	31
thats not all	31
actually kind of	31
the right and	31
the whole story	31
of doing it	31
to feel the	31
the world what	31
you see are	31
life and death	31
and this kind	31
that women are	31
years of my	31
together and we	31
be in a	31
even if youre	31
all know this	31
miles per hour	31
play a game	31
at this stage	31
we are so	31
as if i	31
a car that	31
understand what the	31
for everyone to	31
here is some	31
of the spinal	31
of whats happening	31
the success of	31
on my head	31
future of the	31
does it matter	31
that in fact	31
during world war	31
a very young	31
access to this	31
out there who	31
you want the	31
for too long	31
sat down and	31
need is a	31
this thing was	31
in our solar	31
thats a little	31
by the name	31
was a bit	31
and machine learning	31
maybe a little	31
of it we	31
to me was	31
of my favorites	31
that are really	31
among other things	31
of things and	31
out of those	31
last five years	31
this with the	31
this video is	31
and my father	31
had a chance	31
in the market	31
to recognize the	31
to the store	31
had access to	31
15 percent of	31
as the most	31
time and space	31
least in the	31
world but we	31
a school in	31
thats a pretty	31
one that has	31
la la la	31
up on a	31
and theyve been	31
than in the	31
you were in	31
im able to	31
cant wait to	31
la li la	31
time to be	31
to be known	31
a closer look	31
it is one	31
supposed to have	31
percent a year	31
your brain has	31
of their life	31
lead to the	31
we must have	31
a total of	31
us back to	31
which would be	31
and once you	31
and then well	31
we know where	31
of the sound	31
that one day	31
our view of	31
what i see	31
you need the	31
has come to	31
as something that	31
and on top	31
and they see	31
time that the	31
so much better	31
much bigger than	31
has been to	31
a little different	31
where we live	31
are forced to	31
people think of	31
is not really	31
it wasnt just	31
doesnt really matter	31
had to deal	31
about it in	31
have to wait	31
said it was	31
for things that	31
now i can	31
is possible to	31
of the century	31
14 years old	31
i find this	31
about the way	31
what they say	31
to be present	31
to you a	31
dont think about	31
she said that	30
i always wanted	30
it has an	30
on this platform	30
watts per square	30
problem is the	30
the magnetic field	30
on a piece	30
in my research	30
give him a	30
of the top	30
is so good	30
that makes sense	30
expect it to	30
im looking at	30
lets just take	30
up in front	30
your brain and	30
and if that	30
being in a	30
percent in the	30
our form of	30
brain of a	30
my life in	30
a decade ago	30
me to think	30
together with the	30
i came in	30
is a whole	30
first day in	30
new generation of	30
but it will	30
life that i	30
and more of	30
but the way	30
of bees in	30
and every day	30
i think im	30
out to me	30
six years ago	30
that as we	30
all of its	30
all around me	30
it was on	30
and its true	30
of our solar	30
decided to take	30
as i can	30
there are certain	30
we have here	30
about this and	30
i told my	30
tell you one	30
that will allow	30
is made up	30
look like the	30
is where you	30
life beyond earth	30
were living in	30
i started getting	30
and try and	30
six months later	30
my parents were	30
can build a	30
not that i	30
important to me	30
the first things	30
want people to	30
make you feel	30
10 years old	30
for years and	30
then in the	30
the privilege of	30
in my family	30
to take all	30
so he can	30
when you take	30
ago i was	30
find in the	30
be kind of	30
i was always	30
not an option	30
have to learn	30
tasks that we	30
and these people	30
to do if	30
for 15 years	30
the food and	30
of the only	30
things that weve	30
and that has	30
is out there	30
its still a	30
take you back	30
was obsessed with	30
into the next	30
them and we	30
24 hours a	30
civil rights movement	30
can be in	30
so to speak	30
there were other	30
it gives you	30
do and what	30
women who were	30
and use it	30
a great career	30
to introduce you	30
and then ill	30
large numbers of	30
basically the same	30
can do and	30
of dealing with	30
is the greatest	30
but the other	30
around the sun	30
the prime minister	30
in the data	30
is a project	30
the story and	30
know that it	30
is that an	30
was born and	30
which are the	30
that and then	30
not only is	30
in the backyard	30
and closer to	30
of this work	30
could tell you	30
going on there	30
with the first	30
country that is	30
to be careful	30
outside of our	30
on the roof	30
for me in	30
up to this	30
it was taken	30
this country and	30
of my body	30
decided that i	30
next 10 years	30
even have a	30
with the people	30
i would ask	30
were thinking about	30
rather than a	30
lot more about	30
each of them	30
the world economic	30
because he had	30
do all the	30
with the word	30
have the power	30
its something we	30
life on this	30
what you could	30
to spend a	30
for a new	30
a tribute to	30
fair to say	30
to solve them	30
someone who is	30
he used to	30
can do anything	30
but with the	30
as to what	30
the only time	30
interested in is	30
away from it	30
you will never	30
for me was	30
the chain of	30
and it works	30
it became a	30
they live in	30
population of the	30
across the board	30
in time and	30
because thats how	30
lab in the	30
when i realized	30
and what theyre	30
and i noticed	30
like you see	30
next to me	30
ended up with	30
if you make	30
large hadron collider	30
what we all	30
number of things	30
to protect them	30
what they need	30
the complexity of	30
may have a	30
in the video	30
weve ever seen	30
it makes it	30
this picture of	30
at any point	30
is the solution	30
to the real	30
the hundreds of	30
walk into a	30
still have to	30
high school students	30
i left the	30
but the question	30
as we move	30
i would call	30
that human beings	30
point here is	30
a case of	30
the secret of	30
which we call	30
just told you	30
time to get	30
about all of	30
think one of	30
said that he	30
to save lives	30
that makes me	30
back together again	30
up there and	30
just as a	30
that weve got	30
went into the	30
but because i	30
the thing thats	30
like i have	30
the evidence is	30
i work on	30
they get to	30
nature of reality	30
it had a	30
this was just	30
in the economic	30
let me describe	30
you cant even	30
here today to	30
if you ever	30
it but it	30
this is now	30
the economic sphere	30
how about a	30
these two things	30
turned around and	30
you cant just	30
did you see	30
belongs to the	30
come to understand	30
to the back	30
so thats why	30
we dont understand	30
wouldnt have to	30
in our cities	30
to ask a	30
to make money	30
in doing this	30
but it isnt	30
and they put	30
that can go	30
i dont feel	30
bring to the	30
is to understand	30
were not talking	30
you and you	30
i thought this	30
think about is	30
we took the	30
brings us to	30
of years of	30
will one day	30
have to recognize	30
everything we can	30
in exactly the	30
the pursuit of	30
role to play	30
except for the	30
first of these	30
i wake up	30
can do the	30
a cell phone	30
thing that happened	30
is to build	30
to ask questions	30
an example from	30
clean energy sources	30
that does not	30
is when you	30
there really is	30
have on the	30
working memory capacity	30
are not only	30
a heart attack	30
objects in the	30
are the two	30
its just like	30
lives and the	30
if you saw	30
off the coast	30
to wait for	30
and he thought	30
this picture is	30
we could look	30
we find a	30
there to be	30
as a great	30
we figure out	30
your whole life	30
a right to	30
its good for	30
then were going	30
i was lucky	30
the operating system	30
and we live	30
in africa and	30
as i look	30
of the robot	30
because of how	30
in the developed	30
of these three	30
to the door	30
life on the	30
anything to do	30
on a little	30
from the time	30
a really nice	30
made them feel	30
more so than	30
what we consider	30
is the internet	30
discovered in the	30
very far away	30
this data and	30
really believe that	30
stuff that we	30
to build up	30
im sorry to	30
to create this	30
the thought that	30
what we get	30
of them as	30
is the question	30
tackling novel situations	30
would be so	30
i have seen	30
the top right	30
blood flow changes	30
that we never	30
only people who	30
high blood pressure	30
their friends and	30
a year of	30
the notion that	30
think about our	30
let me say	30
you might know	30
the five senses	30
with it but	30
second industrial revolution	30
you didnt even	30
so what youre	30
that you cannot	30
take a long	30
and theres the	30
into each other	30
might not have	30
on the beach	30
places that are	30
i really believe	30
remind you of	30
twice as much	30
theyre doing it	30
as old as	30
the world needs	30
and it says	30
in a big	30
is also the	30
in north carolina	30
do when you	30
what if it	30
back up to	30
what i hope	30
the country that	30
they dont just	30
less than five	30
could be used	30
you to see	30
the department of	30
went to see	30
like this i	30
about 10 percent	30
we dont talk	30
it by the	30
when i looked	30
rather than just	30
were sort of	30
could use to	30
of women in	30
you look in	30
working at the	30
personal dna machines	30
of my students	30
to communicate with	30
the one percent	30
of a problem	30
produced by the	30
you come from	30
excited about this	30
was just like	30
some form of	30
where you could	30
three years later	30
a social network	30
for their own	30
a sequence of	30
of the media	30
they talk about	30
that need to	30
i was having	30
a much bigger	30
part of your	30
and were just	30
in a village	30
because they want	30
of women and	30
they dont like	30
we are looking	30
that you may	30
and they made	30
they were actually	30
half billion years	30
i was 14	30
youll be able	30
she must have	30
take us to	30
doing things that	30
it was time	30
the price of	30
its basically a	30
to know where	30
we can come	30
in the store	30
no reason to	30
we started asking	29
i was coming	29
do two things	29
and they want	29
how much the	29
but as soon	29
is from a	29
which we are	29
up to us	29
i heard about	29
a measure of	29
do you say	29
do with all	29
people and the	29
in the laboratory	29
it might have	29
let me ask	29
not only does	29
long as we	29
war on terror	29
the early 90s	29
of mars and	29
been a lot	29
if that is	29
the english language	29
and you need	29
everywhere in the	29
power of a	29
up with some	29
do with that	29
because we want	29
dont worry about	29
the top five	29
to put together	29
99 percent of	29
think they are	29
in saudi arabia	29
in this image	29
this is still	29
going to let	29
you see something	29
work on a	29
the body so	29
so i tried	29
who had been	29
and its no	29
the implications of	29
the family and	29
much as we	29
i could get	29
are a number	29
order to understand	29
knew i had	29
through a lot	29
in it that	29
is the answer	29
did a little	29
like to show	29
people are not	29
in that same	29
i have ever	29
ready for a	29
than we have	29
we get it	29
need to ask	29
at the front	29
of our body	29
numbers on the	29
while they were	29
any of that	29
were the ones	29
about it this	29
the same technology	29
we fail to	29
actually want to	29
based on our	29
what they think	29
is how much	29
of years to	29
was not going	29
someone like me	29
what youll see	29
and those that	29
of the family	29
if you compare	29
to tell him	29
that weve had	29
the red line	29
to become more	29
the two of	29
a moment and	29
the quantum world	29
ended up being	29
were all going	29
one in every	29
and he went	29
as we all	29
which means we	29
do we take	29
planets that are	29
what had happened	29
know that theres	29
middle east and	29
even when i	29
an entirely new	29
in this place	29
he can see	29
more than 20	29
you never know	29
is designed to	29
that these people	29
and whats interesting	29
into the room	29
is the size	29
why i was	29
and we took	29
in the park	29
to run for	29
ive been studying	29
protect us from	29
job as a	29
on the main	29
about them and	29
was to have	29
when they came	29
most of its	29
thing about the	29
we are also	29
there with the	29
lot of research	29
bad news is	29
a clean energy	29
the political and	29
in the company	29
every corner of	29
not a question	29
of fossil fuels	29
that it might	29
i think people	29
of a car	29
were doing it	29
did is we	29
is responsible for	29
i give you	29
make sure you	29
same way as	29
as all of	29
out that we	29
one that is	29
make sure we	29
only have one	29
my country is	29
thing on the	29
this tells us	29
is the case	29
those people in	29
we went back	29
tell us something	29
what im trying	29
of course its	29
and so a	29
go for it	29
us how to	29
people of the	29
that are on	29
is perhaps the	29
be the last	29
be great if	29
as well the	29
turned to me	29
start to change	29
us in a	29
look into the	29
when i tell	29
to be some	29
read and write	29
to the north	29
in five years	29
solution to this	29
about the first	29
to get access	29
for at least	29
is if you	29
telling you that	29
doesnt mean we	29
but then they	29
all i could	29
the limits of	29
and he asked	29
thats how i	29
the exact opposite	29
a police officer	29
in this field	29
in europe and	29
could think of	29
now im not	29
to take in	29
up to be	29
of the social	29
hundreds and hundreds	29
of the children	29
and much more	29
little bit and	29
right now the	29
now i know	29
you might even	29
you to join	29
just dont have	29
in one year	29
you are and	29
that it takes	29
that they know	29
a really long	29
world is not	29
we know now	29
the finish line	29
on their way	29
for you and	29
its a kind	29
we can even	29
the human condition	29
this mean for	29
to the size	29
no longer have	29
that might have	29
in times of	29
to develop the	29
they make me	29
one of its	29
go on the	29
with me and	29
it wasnt that	29
to turn on	29
i just showed	29
a long story	29
theres just one	29
we are just	29
heard about the	29
even if it	29
not only for	29
what were talking	29
only ones who	29
things like the	29
you really have	29
and they started	29
the muslim world	29
96 percent of	29
goal was to	29
he had been	29
so that means	29
has actually been	29
look for a	29
you think they	29
you one of	29
us as a	29
its very exciting	29
and it worked	29
machine that can	29
we thought that	29
to be going	29
bigger than the	29
to be just	29
we rely on	29
of them was	29
a life of	29
to what is	29
countries that have	29
starting to get	29
that were doing	29
being part of	29
are more than	29
to happen and	29
the same in	29
we believe in	29
the city and	29
also believe that	29
up with an	29
am i doing	29
a little baby	29
on for the	29
on the blockchain	29
speed of sound	29
here and i	29
all we have	29
an hour and	29
i want it	29
so here i	29
have always been	29
that but i	29
you saw the	29
not at the	29
youve heard about	29
you could actually	29
of the rest	29
the modern world	29
a large number	29
take a closer	29
lot of human	29
there is still	29
life as a	29
need to create	29
lets call it	29
is so powerful	29
off the ground	29
the narrative of	29
and the person	29
the eyes and	29
of you out	29
to fix the	29
so this robot	29
once you get	29
to see is	29
why do they	29
did they do	29
to find an	29
whats really going	29
how to create	29
but if it	29
looks like the	29
this when i	29
to see more	29
then i was	29
you get your	29
on the most	29
its supposed to	29
i will say	29
very quickly and	29
think you have	29
that we knew	29
the same question	29
the waste from	29
a difference between	29
000 species of	29
me out of	29
get to be	29
to show them	29
deep into the	29
a colleague of	29
its what we	29
of the state	29
the arc of	29
to have our	29
that right now	29
in the american	29
these people who	29
solar system and	29
and with this	29
this is different	29
of something that	29
once in a	29
even if its	29
able to help	29
i hope i	29
how it is	29
was not in	29
that our universe	29
me that they	29
where it gets	29
think you can	29
of the sky	29
i think youll	29
that doesnt have	29
word for it	29
on this earth	29
the second part	29
problems that we	29
you the first	29
the tradition of	29
could do a	29
we should use	29
we should look	29
time to make	29
and they asked	29
my first day	29
kind of cool	29
we could see	29
its an amazing	29
to the story	29
he could have	29
to my own	29
that you think	29
superintelligent ai that	29
keep track of	29
and so much	29
a very complicated	29
is there an	29
because you see	29
not able to	29
you may remember	29
as many of	29
cup of coffee	29
theyre the ones	29
years to get	29
to a tiny	29
of an animal	29
theyre doing is	29
once a week	29
how is that	29
its almost as	29
to live a	29
but its important	29
there is only	29
as a writer	29
on my phone	29
images of the	29
in the coming	29
to us we	29
it is no	29
the internet has	29
knew that i	29
so over the	29
for 20 years	29
and before i	29
need to keep	29
whole range of	29
we create a	29
amounts of data	29
the forest and	29
i think for	29
and these were	29
present to you	29
theres no question	29
for people with	29
in the study	29
me and he	29
is how it	29
live a life	29
what did i	29
had to say	29
that thats the	29
to the city	29
have the capacity	29
have the best	29
many other countries	29
out with a	29
i spent the	29
from a different	29
me take you	29
i was out	29
i love it	29
have the courage	29
means that if	29
they like to	29
means you have	29
those who were	29
if they had	29
down the highway	29
ever since i	29
we went into	29
about what happened	29
to overcome the	29
its hard for	29
it i think	29
that the internet	29
is the opposite	29
at the lhc	29
because it would	29
so then we	29
tons of co2	29
see whats going	29
trust each other	29
we find is	29
were all the	29
things going on	29
so you cant	29
you can call	29
where people are	29
one that we	29
and go to	28
for our kids	28
the expression of	28
that i thought	28
went up to	28
to build these	28
people who can	28
out of here	28
the species that	28
in a while	28
so for me	28
two things that	28
much more interesting	28
we will never	28
in the digital	28
the office of	28
to get something	28
the wizard of	28
him in a	28
that and so	28
them to go	28
important is that	28
youll see in	28
one side of	28
three of them	28
next to you	28
really trying to	28
not because they	28
and that can	28
than anything else	28
portion of the	28
to meet that	28
people who want	28
been shown to	28
to the extent	28
a world thats	28
a brand new	28
go to mars	28
in a hundred	28
which is quite	28
that i saw	28
important thing is	28
introduced me to	28
the same size	28
such as this	28
you are probably	28
in my hand	28
ive never seen	28
throughout all of	28
at a level	28
rides per day	28
as kind of	28
the system is	28
a single person	28
weve got the	28
up a little	28
all this information	28
000 rides per	28
think if we	28
that i grew	28
theres something that	28
the corner of	28
was about the	28
of high school	28
im happy to	28
and with a	28
to this one	28
so at the	28
so close to	28
role of the	28
i think when	28
of data that	28
things that people	28
the stories that	28
is like the	28
in the lives	28
in our minds	28
sound like a	28
i remember thinking	28
i had in	28
the air is	28
thats when we	28
will have a	28
of the second	28
will be better	28
was based on	28
goes like this	28
to be looking	28
they dont need	28
you have that	28
we could go	28
what it takes	28
of the conversation	28
in the far	28
you get older	28
and it gets	28
share it with	28
on my face	28
questions about the	28
example this is	28
enough of a	28
i got an	28
come to this	28
where youre going	28
are the first	28
in the upper	28
do is i	28
each of you	28
today is a	28
love each other	28
look at her	28
who has ever	28
the rainy season	28
about to get	28
are aware of	28
this talk is	28
were the most	28
between us and	28
actually one of	28
but to me	28
all the money	28
now when i	28
thats the kind	28
were all in	28
in an area	28
out as a	28
i cant say	28
could never have	28
then it was	28
my talk today	28
women of color	28
the title of	28
put into the	28
so its really	28
of food and	28
its made of	28
next five years	28
i wonder if	28
a cloud of	28
something else that	28
can see where	28
trying to go	28
you to imagine	28
right up to	28
may seem like	28
we no longer	28
work as a	28
you could say	28
thats not going	28
a computer programmer	28
cant see it	28
our minds are	28
its a problem	28
i can even	28
i have here	28
there and so	28
is that as	28
south africa and	28
that was very	28
and many more	28
fact that there	28
that you like	28
leads me to	28
they start to	28
the young people	28
and to me	28
stuck in the	28
people and i	28
that it actually	28
was designed to	28
from the other	28
get the idea	28
is a more	28
now so we	28
if you believe	28
so excited to	28
i was afraid	28
use it as	28
last time i	28
i didnt expect	28
theres only one	28
small part of	28
be the one	28
i was writing	28
the ancient greek	28
thats how you	28
thing we have	28
the ted stage	28
something that could	28
life it was	28
when i feel	28
because thats where	28
looking at that	28
to clean up	28
make it happen	28
learned that i	28
way or another	28
could not do	28
care of our	28
in them and	28
this sense of	28
of the old	28
that that would	28
to have these	28
we depend on	28
you may ask	28
people have to	28
because it looks	28
does is it	28
these are three	28
because he has	28
and we even	28
also want to	28
an interest in	28
have seen the	28
two types of	28
it was clearly	28
access to information	28
about the nature	28
the blood vessels	28
problem was that	28
and when youre	28
whole lot more	28
hope that the	28
a conversation with	28
at it as	28
if you come	28
can try to	28
want to work	28
art and culture	28
for that is	28
but with a	28
the people i	28
anyone in this	28
half of them	28
to hear the	28
think were going	28
for it to	28
theres a new	28
to have them	28
far the most	28
have a couple	28
my family was	28
is about as	28
into a little	28
was happening in	28
alone in the	28
if youre trying	28
the cover of	28
im sure some	28
and so there	28
you have these	28
is because we	28
world where we	28
the position of	28
the likelihood of	28
most people dont	28
to bring in	28
this was in	28
the victims of	28
i think he	28
forward to the	28
the vertical axis	28
were the first	28
if they want	28
if youre an	28
can get the	28
that as the	28
in 20 years	28
you want it	28
it were a	28
on all of	28
anything like that	28
lets take the	28
she wants to	28
i looked up	28
went out and	28
feel like you	28
i did my	28
it when i	28
to play in	28
you look up	28
the first week	28
in many places	28
be seen as	28
is called a	28
to reach the	28
we need an	28
of a mountain	28
a book about	28
that was an	28
doing a lot	28
of every 10	28
none of these	28
go on a	28
to be comfortable	28
at a rate	28
is important to	28
years and years	28
in the environment	28
was an amazing	28
so we came	28
all these other	28
can also do	28
not to say	28
to be pretty	28
to 20 percent	28
was given to	28
to close with	28
turns out there	28
i first started	28
can actually use	28
and she would	28
hear the word	28
we would not	28
of the kind	28
that it works	28
of them to	28
it might just	28
do want to	28
my own experience	28
are based on	28
of the environment	28
in the pacific	28
who had to	28
the real laughs	28
the sorts of	28
it and they	28
when we put	28
to go there	28
people in our	28
to hear that	28
so we asked	28
need to stop	28
and just to	28
the thing about	28
of the blue	28
on other people	28
of in the	28
not even the	28
another example of	28
on the very	28
there are in	28
my hands and	28
im not alone	28
what are these	28
according to a	28
we look back	28
about a few	28
theres a few	28
a million years	28
the goal is	28
me of the	28
move to the	28
things about the	28
people with the	28
see if they	28
not the kind	28
to describe a	28
about what the	28
the problems that	28
as big as	28
everyone in this	28
they take a	28
was ready to	28
with their own	28
and they just	28
and the main	28
before we get	28
down from the	28
to the problem	28
but it means	28
trying to use	28
wait for them	28
world trade center	28
the destruction of	28
work very well	28
in the 1950s	28
we have our	28
go a little	28
as a journalist	28
the cerebral cortex	28
for as long	28
and we use	28
i read about	28
it would make	28
number of different	28
the environment and	28
years is not	28
it is its	28
the extent that	28
way the world	28
i cant see	28
through the air	28
but not just	28
for such a	28
to change that	28
more than any	28
thing we did	28
was thinking about	28
with a different	28
think that thats	28
its important for	28
the world more	28
the criminal justice	28
was not an	28
relationship with the	28
in which a	28
gave us the	28
in the best	28
it seemed like	28
that you make	28
going to school	28
have made a	28
building blocks of	28
in the box	28
has been an	28
weve seen that	28
to detect and	28
of this world	28
say this is	28
easy to do	28
and i tell	28
to learn more	28
a few other	28
does it have	28
of this sort	28
of a relationship	28
time and i	28
on the board	28
male and female	28
they were being	28
can do so	28
of the more	28
changing the world	28
i call a	28
got to make	28
how much we	28
a billion dollars	28
great way to	28
what you know	28
of the worst	28
have the tools	28
when you want	28
and the new	28
roots and leaves	28
to the sky	28
of the building	28
i have had	28
its based on	28
the virtual you	28
be talking about	28
and they make	28
and i go	28
happens when the	28
and the truth	28
to be human	28
iraq and afghanistan	28
go to bed	28
and we made	28
after a couple	28
that many people	28
a small number	28
what ive learned	28
who are more	28
want to close	28
no way of	28
she was so	28
that youre looking	28
the way this	28
way i can	28
want to believe	28
how it was	28
and i wrote	28
do i know	28
in love and	28
a good friend	28
the institutions that	28
from some of	28
to him and	28
about our own	28
do know that	28
started looking for	28
the tone of	28
back into our	28
percent of women	28
the rule of	28
does not work	28
as i know	28
to be safe	28
we have just	28
and i read	28
of the many	28
the good life	28
who said that	28
the time theyre	28
we are part	28
the diameter of	28
i thought the	28
people have a	28
within a few	28
with so many	28
no doubt that	28
and more about	28
many kinds of	28
i can change	28
there was not	28
going to kill	28
the printing press	28
you went to	28
wizard of oz	28
the bulk of	28
cant afford to	28
my family and	28
solution to the	28
is in this	28
this is part	28
more to the	28
its exactly the	28
of the black	28
help us understand	28
some of their	28
we know a	28
way up to	28
america and the	28
we only have	28
have a much	28
that the chinese	28
think of how	28
then i went	28
a mix of	28
if i dont	28
looked at this	28
millions of computers	28
it was as	28
dont think i	28
like any other	28
go out into	28
that made it	28
and there i	28
the differences between	28
able to show	28
you see how	28
and thats my	28
a little over	28
be thinking about	28
when you ask	28
they had been	28
a long period	28
can do things	28
so with that	28
can see two	28
quarter of the	28
thats the case	28
i gave a	28
the most difficult	28
does not mean	28
out of his	28
of its kind	28
us away from	28
got me thinking	28
has ever been	28
its as though	28
and find a	28
i was 17	28
less of a	28
old enough to	28
we could not	28
can we build	28
have all of	28
thought that i	28
of these ideas	28
examples of how	27
on the second	27
you talk to	27
i believe this	27
want to run	27
out of them	27
werent going to	27
once you have	27
that of a	27
we all do	27
create something that	27
at a young	27
system in the	27
was more than	27
get the world	27
because i believe	27
are doing this	27
and so far	27
of an affair	27
maybe this is	27
wants to know	27
then we asked	27
i found it	27
are in this	27
who they were	27
to test it	27
have learned to	27
each other to	27
we wouldnt be	27
in a large	27
be looking for	27
you for listening	27
you consider that	27
picket fence and	27
is the source	27
what other people	27
thought of it	27
have sex with	27
have you been	27
why it is	27
only one of	27
when we ask	27
not the most	27
of us think	27
that if they	27
that we havent	27
then we ask	27
he had the	27
was to create	27
they would go	27
wanted to tell	27
they also have	27
is not so	27
example of what	27
and this really	27
be that way	27
we have many	27
of the physics	27
an app that	27
to your brain	27
it like this	27
thats in the	27
the network and	27
we put the	27
and i give	27
earth and mars	27
of the african	27
have in our	27
made by the	27
past 10 years	27
next thing is	27
up for the	27
to try this	27
so back to	27
dream of a	27
really think that	27
value of the	27
telling us that	27
i got back	27
they had the	27
i was with	27
tends to be	27
regions of the	27
more than they	27
he lost his	27
for some people	27
that happens in	27
that i found	27
at their own	27
back of my	27
we have for	27
my life to	27
is a serious	27
you can start	27
core of the	27
i can actually	27
going to read	27
had been a	27
in our brains	27
you have some	27
them and then	27
and thanks to	27
the hand of	27
talk about today	27
on what we	27
i would just	27
so one thing	27
the cool thing	27
to an end	27
as if its	27
like to look	27
getting too much	27
the distinction between	27
never want to	27
i was telling	27
you would never	27
so much from	27
of the science	27
to fit in	27
of the cosmos	27
and even if	27
high school in	27
a machine that	27
reasons why we	27
that is because	27
it a few	27
we think it	27
at one time	27
this isnt a	27
a huge challenge	27
a new idea	27
we also see	27
all that time	27
how much you	27
from the left	27
takes place in	27
of thing that	27
same thing that	27
in my heart	27
may be thinking	27
i made my	27
instead of having	27
are you now	27
way to work	27
but theres something	27
you will get	27
us something about	27
try and make	27
the ones with	27
the cells in	27
it goes into	27
why is the	27
over 10 years	27
do this for	27
theyve got a	27
a tool to	27
three days later	27
get up in	27
so we want	27
world economic forum	27
see if i	27
get to work	27
a point in	27
but what happens	27
born and raised	27
there you have	27
ill talk about	27
as youll see	27
exactly what i	27
especially if you	27
how to fix	27
few of them	27
like you would	27
what happened when	27
room in the	27
the whole point	27
the more likely	27
to take your	27
on an airplane	27
species on the	27
was that they	27
i do a	27
the food chain	27
that i needed	27
of the original	27
make eye contact	27
or in the	27
a world with	27
version of this	27
i just told	27
for me is	27
try and understand	27
our kids to	27
as you may	27
have been on	27
this was going	27
and see that	27
doing in the	27
then there is	27
to explain what	27
like me who	27
and play with	27
outside of your	27
and what youre	27
vision of the	27
i put on	27
i asked myself	27
started looking at	27
and as they	27
key to the	27
to take out	27
at the point	27
her in the	27
there is so	27
has been done	27
in the modern	27
percent of americans	27
doesnt want to	27
two of us	27
like the ones	27
through the water	27
its about a	27
to do good	27
ive always been	27
going to really	27
world in a	27
is very good	27
i say to	27
corners of the	27
me in my	27
the past 10	27
and ill show	27
we come to	27
i do with	27
100 million people	27
me and she	27
women who have	27
some good news	27
i find myself	27
came to be	27
but its an	27
you use the	27
very excited about	27
have a whole	27
who are we	27
it actually is	27
what they said	27
we get here	27
write a book	27
up by the	27
this robot is	27
to do today	27
so i didnt	27
my friends were	27
on earth that	27
coming down the	27
there are billions	27
our economy is	27
you looked at	27
so now weve	27
if you would	27
to sit down	27
and all sorts	27
the freedom to	27
you do to	27
of neurons in	27
have the potential	27
goes on and	27
the car is	27
theres very little	27
will end up	27
got a job	27
it shows that	27
do we find	27
i just did	27
im tired of	27
three billion years	27
before i was	27
is to bring	27
so now i	27
it for you	27
is actually not	27
we do a	27
here is where	27
in your car	27
by a guy	27
say that they	27
but we cant	27
surface of mars	27
the world at	27
the sky is	27
and is now	27
related to the	27
we dont like	27
are responsible for	27
the standard model	27
you could take	27
and on a	27
questions about how	27
that no other	27
of the number	27
and the end	27
a problem with	27
did we do	27
goes up and	27
the day of	27
areas in the	27
and for those	27
that sense of	27
what he said	27
thats because we	27
it was something	27
me on a	27
further and further	27
we think this	27
this project was	27
they are less	27
to the person	27
a new thing	27
create a better	27
few of these	27
i am here	27
to look into	27
started to see	27
can give you	27
to speak with	27
it up into	27
you could not	27
piece of dna	27
in the newspaper	27
when youre talking	27
that moment that	27
managed to get	27
she had to	27
that as you	27
is a matter	27
to stop the	27
and where i	27
the atmosphere of	27
is true for	27
enough to see	27
have to speak	27
make their own	27
you go through	27
why its so	27
you go in	27
figured out that	27
black lives matter	27
but its very	27
people like the	27
you see where	27
you probably know	27
and they look	27
20 years from	27
to call the	27
another way to	27
the world by	27
that are out	27
what i love	27
much more of	27
the increase in	27
of his time	27
turn around and	27
do so i	27
i learned how	27
one billion people	27
areas that are	27
honest with you	27
far as i	27
you can explore	27
the world record	27
put that in	27
and its something	27
we knew we	27
than people who	27
us to a	27
a video that	27
at all i	27
amount of data	27
going to college	27
you only have	27
know what happened	27
or not and	27
development of the	27
if this was	27
they may have	27
me to take	27
idea of jihad	27
go to an	27
other side so	27
everybody has a	27
four times the	27
and i wondered	27
future of our	27
made it to	27
was interested in	27
is a tool	27
said to myself	27
on the walls	27
in our history	27
i see this	27
years ago with	27
in my experience	27
i couldnt find	27
just this week	27
another way of	27
we have lots	27
much like a	27
on the computer	27
thank you and	27
and the results	27
kind of world	27
a cup of	27
i really am	27
things to do	27
about it we	27
can be very	27
is looking at	27
to the environment	27
and where the	27
me to come	27
the challenges of	27
times the speed	27
than they are	27
the scientific method	27
my hope is	27
work at a	27
the last 30	27
this little girl	27
are a part	27
what percentage of	27
do with my	27
is good for	27
when you consider	27
i do that	27
are many people	27
and when she	27
you can run	27
i went into	27
for a number	27
future of work	27
and i spent	27
what if its	27
to keep it	27
number one is	27
in any case	27
and more like	27
hard to find	27
its clear that	27
the light that	27
the most profound	27
came down to	27
nice to have	27
used to go	27
going to pick	27
and ive just	27
do you find	27
its the best	27
for a world	27
because theyre not	27
in the winter	27
ive been to	27
from the brain	27
two of these	27
much of our	27
understanding of what	27
we can and	27
need in order	27
was talking to	27
much about the	27
the car and	27
the federal government	27
she said to	27
a year later	27
have found that	27
in an era	27
the robot is	27
mean for the	27
hand if you	27
they would say	27
the direction of	27
the properties of	27
end with a	27
they can have	27
looking at them	27
people trying to	27
dont really have	27
had to work	27
that we often	27
key thing is	27
to do its	27
in my group	27
a trillion dollars	27
would look at	27
that the other	27
dont need a	27
think we know	27
ways we can	27
and weve had	27
in a totally	27
the expansion of	27
all walks of	27
have all these	27
in the rest	27
my sister and	27
had a couple	27
that some people	27
was forced to	27
of it its	27
the men in	27
about three years	27
took a lot	27
we started using	27
leap of faith	27
just for the	27
is more likely	27
like when you	27
found that in	27
every now and	27
been involved in	27
the bottom and	27
hard for us	27
now weve got	27
you on the	27
to fight against	27
that if a	27
tells me that	27
to know if	27
a great story	27
give you two	27
anything that is	27
to find and	27
tell me about	27
that were being	27
we started looking	27
something out of	27
involved in this	27
the possibilities of	27
experience that i	27
to help him	27
do here is	27
for how to	27
said that i	27
his name was	27
one of two	27
idea of using	27
to win the	27
of my career	27
how technology is	27
from it and	27
with the right	27
years trying to	27
hours a week	27
put on the	27
little girl who	27
to get from	27
things at the	27
who grew up	27
is to create	27
of a larger	27
a copy of	27
have such a	27
more than you	27
i went and	27
it is just	27
were asked to	27
at all to	27
nothing to hide	27
that its our	27
through some of	27
to the sea	27
and its one	27
have been so	27
do something else	27
is from the	27
she had been	27
the logic of	27
you on a	27
problem with that	27
to act on	27
so imagine if	27
out what it	27
i returned to	27
of how this	27
think the answer	27
we think the	27
as i am	27
these are my	27
what youre thinking	27
about a quarter	27
in a black	27
the brain does	27
last thing i	27
the picture of	27
we admit that	27
so we think	26
was going through	26
thats a problem	26
of people on	26
we have one	26
to avoid that	26
cannot tell you	26
think about them	26
li la la	26
as a group	26
to find these	26
and to have	26
into the solar	26
get in a	26
same way they	26
a model that	26
example of that	26
that the government	26
from the front	26
have the most	26
in fact the	26
thoughts and emotions	26
of a good	26
of dna and	26
on the human	26
now in your	26
no idea that	26
at them and	26
we have had	26
life in a	26
of the money	26
of different things	26
to lead to	26
when i showed	26
to share it	26
know that when	26
youre saying that	26
it starts to	26
this problem and	26
or whether its	26
deeper into the	26
the bottom is	26
were not really	26
because the only	26
about these things	26
it and that	26
people think about	26
concerned with the	26
not know how	26
in the neighborhood	26
save the world	26
but i thought	26
in favor of	26
make a little	26
of different kinds	26
individuals who are	26
they had never	26
what i said	26
not only can	26
can see all	26
will see in	26
out that if	26
and more complex	26
the side effects	26
doing this work	26
you deal with	26
we can live	26
the way were	26
i remember my	26
these young people	26
but it had	26
no doubt about	26
that you use	26
what should i	26
they say that	26
and take a	26
want to eat	26
ones that we	26
a couple weeks	26
tell us how	26
when they see	26
i said before	26
a kid who	26
at an early	26
the only problem	26
now with the	26
to this country	26
was invited to	26
much of this	26
of its own	26
how about the	26
can come up	26
day and then	26
over 50 percent	26
the extent to	26
to move to	26
when theres a	26
for young people	26
my best friend	26
the past two	26
at the local	26
think that they	26
them to have	26
teamed up with	26
we had some	26
and the red	26
ibms deep blue	26
that is an	26
and the government	26
i met a	26
is why you	26
turn them into	26
create our own	26
and when its	26
and im a	26
work and the	26
it can take	26
will make a	26
do some of	26
the neurons in	26
something else its	26
an experience that	26
the only people	26
me a little	26
this as well	26
pretty much like	26
can help you	26
i started this	26
really know what	26
didnt know about	26
them and they	26
as well but	26
much in the	26
so right now	26
relationship to the	26
find out whats	26
we did we	26
who would have	26
we may have	26
the second largest	26
to make your	26
thats what this	26
that this could	26
why did i	26
a global scale	26
to produce a	26
from one another	26
few days later	26
the red brigades	26
rules of the	26
much do you	26
he wrote a	26
is how you	26
use to build	26
dont we have	26
something that happened	26
can actually make	26
and now im	26
head of a	26
can get it	26
that would help	26
and what happened	26
this we have	26
fascinated by the	26
people to know	26
and here i	26
is not one	26
about the importance	26
of this problem	26
he made this	26
plants that are	26
they dont get	26
and it happened	26
was the very	26
it would look	26
one hand and	26
with what we	26
two things one	26
is no way	26
a long history	26
difference in the	26
that turned out	26
what they had	26
fortunate enough to	26
world right now	26
and putting them	26
that was made	26
percent of american	26
of the show	26
half the size	26
in the netherlands	26
how did they	26
in space and	26
i work in	26
women are not	26
its what makes	26
wont be able	26
the other two	26
he didnt have	26
we do all	26
that we work	26
remember that we	26
it and make	26
are doing it	26
and the bottom	26
the potential of	26
just talking about	26
heres how it	26
this is some	26
so theyre going	26
a photograph of	26
that was so	26
few months later	26
be possible to	26
that way and	26
all the others	26
point i want	26
me the most	26
images like this	26
place to live	26
can do what	26
purpose of the	26
the same story	26
the rich world	26
we invest in	26
thats where i	26
but from the	26
we have those	26
you cant go	26
do something with	26
are good at	26
go out of	26
think we are	26
want to bring	26
she was one	26
on a project	26
one kind of	26
and many others	26
pointed out that	26
to set up	26
like if you	26
you can move	26
faith in the	26
one day in	26
it doesnt just	26
and theres two	26
they were also	26
with very little	26
that allowed us	26
you put your	26
every day in	26
already have a	26
as a single	26
to do here	26
up the road	26
our job to	26
believe in god	26
a company in	26
can see some	26
me in a	26
to that of	26
fact that he	26
the brain as	26
understand that there	26
we knew it	26
to us so	26
isnt just about	26
gap between the	26
i get it	26
the phoenix islands	26
so we look	26
as the first	26
just not enough	26
now is a	26
even when we	26
tiny fraction of	26
and then after	26
and you start	26
we shouldnt be	26
and our ability	26
a better future	26
were listening to	26
are only three	26
to make up	26
it took us	26
yellowstone national park	26
the second time	26
to tell our	26
and weve done	26
it all together	26
of this experiment	26
really understand what	26
12 percent of	26
the founders of	26
the civil war	26
we were like	26
but because the	26
the mind of	26
the planet is	26
i dont get	26
time in history	26
and we might	26
was possible to	26
world would be	26
this is for	26
generation of young	26
you would do	26
to do their	26
place on the	26
but weve got	26
we call that	26
in which it	26
me to go	26
probably the biggest	26
do any of	26
have time for	26
at the new	26
i quit my	26
the time he	26
this concept of	26
not there yet	26
video of the	26
the universe at	26
hard it is	26
do all kinds	26
the morning of	26
the nest entrance	26
and here it	26
a glass of	26
make this happen	26
it comes in	26
up from the	26
the police and	26
working with a	26
and this means	26
to the sound	26
for this is	26
makes us feel	26
an extension of	26
anything like this	26
that they actually	26
a little tiny	26
thats just a	26
making it more	26
and tell you	26
they were looking	26
in the plant	26
woman who was	26
as to how	26
one example of	26
think its very	26
and they may	26
is the essence	26
what does a	26
like a very	26
this particular case	26
complicated than that	26
can get that	26
in a state	26
a day of	26
to go a	26
play with the	26
heres a picture	26
life is a	26
of evidence that	26
so i made	26
do with them	26
to us as	26
going on between	26
with all that	26
this is used	26
by using the	26
i set up	26
i thought id	26
it became the	26
was seven years	26
are just the	26
apart from the	26
the room with	26
you can really	26
and the time	26
available in the	26
in brazil and	26
like to go	26
the right of	26
he could not	26
but heres a	26
there for a	26
this thing is	26
through the brain	26
more than what	26
a pretty big	26
we have and	26
in a community	26
is you have	26
think that were	26
on your right	26
the ground up	26
should you be	26
to send a	26
the moment i	26
from a place	26
like the internet	26
staring at the	26
from where i	26
which is in	26
sometimes i get	26
so that if	26
surface of a	26
of a child	26
from the environment	26
put your hand	26
have to decide	26
about a dozen	26
i never had	26
that cant be	26
per day in	26
on the day	26
we do what	26
can choose to	26
in the direction	26
wanted to buy	26
past six years	26
in very different	26
in parts of	26
what on earth	26
children with autism	26
but not all	26
goods and services	26
do you guys	26
worse than that	26
you cant help	26
they do the	26
we see here	26
the reasons i	26
its estimated that	26
trying to explain	26
of having a	26
this is quite	26
that its an	26
doesnt make sense	26
reached out to	26
at every turn	26
here is what	26
i hear you	26
that they use	26
a recording of	26
we really dont	26
story about a	26
to do whatever	26
and then weve	26
we make the	26
the people on	26
ive had the	26
little bits of	26
a people person	26
doing it in	26
and before you	26
director of the	26
we called it	26
love in the	26
do you believe	26
me was the	26
more than 1	26
but most importantly	26
because we live	26
because thats a	26
i can put	26
you were the	26
it gets a	26
on it for	26
why we need	26
do that but	26
going down the	26
came from a	26
feel that we	26
for women in	26
information that we	26
first time the	26
for you i	26
going to leave	26
if thats the	26
and the story	26
for all those	26
my brain is	26
the big picture	26
tells us is	26
and his family	26
you have one	26
in the day	26
and this time	26
whats the point	26
the list of	26
think that in	26
we all share	26
goes on in	26
showing you the	26
so this one	26
but they had	26
compared to a	26
and build a	26
its right here	26
is because i	26
the way our	26
will be to	26
we were there	26
if thats not	26
of this technology	26
we like it	26
describe as a	26
it up in	26
their own country	26
to thank you	26
first one was	26
around the planet	26
sure that i	26
a man of	26
part of his	26
love with the	26
think they should	26
with a story	26
wanted to come	26
that he did	26
all the energy	26
at the intersection	26
a thousand years	26
very much about	26
to see where	26
and we now	26
cause of death	26
on the end	26
and all you	26
you and if	26
believe that in	26
i promise you	26
created in the	26
this technology is	26
got a couple	26
500 years ago	26
it is time	26
bit like this	26
and we keep	26
try to see	26
would be no	26
urge you to	26
its more like	26
something much more	26
to know it	26
have the time	26
to be perfect	26
as sort of	26
as we see	26
maps of the	26
be very careful	26
on how you	26
when i asked	26
can get from	26
times per second	26
as possible and	26
all live in	26
what you cant	26
much as you	26
i actually think	26
me how to	26
all know the	26
forget about the	26
we focus on	26
the web and	26
much better and	26
the leader of	26
on the last	26
to start thinking	26
to do two	26
is not in	26
and then if	26
what you believe	26
a time in	26
not to mention	26
is to find	26
right down to	26
because there were	26
us what to	26
rather than against	26
that this kind	26
we should take	26
know a little	26
put in a	26
would do that	26
spend the rest	26
for a better	26
species in the	26
referred to as	26
it creates a	26
announced that they	26
field of view	26
to a different	26
as a boy	26
would be willing	26
different set of	26
and of the	26
where everything is	26
11 years old	26
to what the	26
the time its	26
know what a	26
you want me	26
this all over	26
function of time	26
and then at	26
of this system	26
from the rest	26
continue to be	26
that now we	26
news for you	26
hands up if	26
difficult to see	26
out of 10	26
that i learned	26
not here to	26
thats something that	26
a tendency to	26
for a small	26
they called it	26
so happy to	25
see something that	25
not just an	25
to the poor	25
on the rise	25
we wont be	25
so i wrote	25
say that this	25
months before the	25
so weve been	25
into a new	25
to something that	25
can interact with	25
we went out	25
you have more	25
a middle school	25
with those people	25
new era of	25
six percent of	25
because of it	25
what you may	25
cant do this	25
memory of the	25
in one study	25
all that we	25
that number is	25
we are right	25
time you see	25
see all of	25
the words we	25
i was no	25
that youre going	25
and i kept	25
like when i	25
of human rights	25
no one was	25
will have the	25
been the case	25
me to make	25
people working on	25
isnt just a	25
on your own	25
the front door	25
the other problem	25
aspect of our	25
the planet that	25
for quite a	25
the right answer	25
that i mentioned	25
of the soil	25
he was also	25
so what id	25
out of work	25
to me so	25
do with what	25
we need the	25
its time we	25
not a bad	25
so we go	25
actually do it	25
other kind of	25
the most likely	25
on the third	25
rocks of the	25
the security of	25
only on the	25
i didnt make	25
didnt even have	25
the last of	25
it was good	25
there are millions	25
ourselves in a	25
of power and	25
the clean energy	25
the matter is	25
terms of being	25
should tell you	25
take a picture	25
do we actually	25
inside of a	25
weve all been	25
anything at all	25
is that to	25
than it does	25
in the red	25
times and i	25
in my community	25
about half of	25
around the country	25
sure many of	25
in the bible	25
thought about the	25
a book called	25
an algorithm that	25
that makes a	25
i have just	25
but when they	25
shows in production	25
years of human	25
this talk and	25
disagree with this	25
when it is	25
i mean the	25
information that was	25
didnt really know	25
people believe that	25
it i dont	25
so bad that	25
the supreme court	25
what if that	25
of technology that	25
that they really	25
a computer program	25
but the only	25
of the smartest	25
and my brother	25
we were so	25
we understand that	25
or whatever it	25
we can evolve	25
say you want	25
we know and	25
the soviet union	25
have chosen to	25
that we still	25
made a lot	25
had to start	25
for about 10	25
who came to	25
one has to	25
when they can	25
in a classroom	25
nothing wrong with	25
we have already	25
but in addition	25
beginning to get	25
people will choose	25
of men and	25
lot to do	25
looking for something	25
think for a	25
much of a	25
we learned that	25
the jewel beetle	25
i became an	25
our bodies and	25
and maybe the	25
if you remember	25
to say no	25
the world thats	25
i graduated from	25
in the woods	25
make me feel	25
we all live	25
the second principle	25
it wasnt going	25
that the average	25
if you change	25
lets be honest	25
that we make	25
and these things	25
and then go	25
discovered that the	25
five of them	25
do whatever it	25
take a lot	25
on the page	25
a new generation	25
and because we	25
can kind of	25
thats why its	25
with a big	25
so how does	25
objectivity and subjectivity	25
walked into a	25
how hard it	25
in the war	25
i believe the	25
embedded in the	25
all familiar with	25
they will have	25
a question for	25
looks like we	25
that but the	25
for us and	25
i made this	25
of her life	25
sheet of paper	25
we learn that	25
but what were	25
or any other	25
with my life	25
you were going	25
from all of	25
to you how	25
where im going	25
i received a	25
matters a lot	25
this with a	25
three shows in	25
way of saying	25
about the problem	25
human body and	25
has been used	25
sit on the	25
and the monkey	25
get to that	25
the english channel	25
real hum is	25
it was never	25
that i describe	25
and her family	25
brothers and sisters	25
lot about the	25
a willingness to	25
where we could	25
three months after	25
ill have a	25
from the top	25
they have different	25
to share that	25
all my life	25
look at things	25
in the vicinity	25
im at the	25
what she was	25
by one of	25
through all the	25
is used for	25
it seemed to	25
of the average	25
there we go	25
people of color	25
of tons of	25
create the conditions	25
the next 15	25
get better and	25
it but the	25
and youre not	25
today when we	25
im not suggesting	25
of the high	25
to send me	25
doing this is	25
of the multiverse	25
these sort of	25
for 100 years	25
what ive done	25
one of many	25
it so we	25
and the robot	25
not that easy	25
to be heard	25
hell of a	25
then i think	25
and about a	25
two dozen years	25
better if we	25
growing in the	25
to account for	25
rid of it	25
not sure what	25
we could just	25
a 70 percent	25
of his family	25
get on the	25
have been to	25
about this question	25
them to a	25
just make a	25
it changes the	25
in a group	25
but we will	25
only way we	25
makes sense to	25
and i like	25
our way to	25
to be clear	25
under the microscope	25
when you make	25
its the team	25
right or wrong	25
do this as	25
he went on	25
but what are	25
they can actually	25
that no matter	25
i believe it	25
wanted to have	25
leave the room	25
hours in the	25
seeing on the	25
we could all	25
you go out	25
and so here	25
exposed to the	25
used to take	25
to take their	25
are not really	25
the only reason	25
you write a	25
happen to us	25
until the end	25
now have the	25
but she was	25
we talked to	25
both of those	25
can understand how	25
chemistry of the	25
to do one	25
in your heart	25
is telling us	25
it because i	25
saw in the	25
different species of	25
heard of it	25
a name for	25
love to have	25
to control our	25
i gave you	25
10 to 20	25
when i woke	25
bigger and bigger	25
things to be	25
start to think	25
that it really	25
do with your	25
the southern hemisphere	25
about this one	25
work with these	25
that i like	25
to learn a	25
to be married	25
whats interesting about	25
from the west	25
do not want	25
so we just	25
as in the	25
end of it	25
this man is	25
each other on	25
was my first	25
home from school	25
did you notice	25
about the things	25
would have the	25
asked people to	25
do this by	25
that there might	25
more often than	25
a man named	25
so much as	25
is used in	25
in every country	25
seven billion people	25
that can make	25
and i ask	25
i still dont	25
so im just	25
how would we	25
it like a	25
need to talk	25
drop out of	25
excited to be	25
the roots of	25
maybe the most	25
because what happens	25
about six months	25
i do believe	25
speed of the	25
have the highest	25
got a phone	25
also be used	25
telling you about	25
all need to	25
want to keep	25
far as we	25
going to open	25
it that the	25
was sitting in	25
in the bronx	25
why dont they	25
of the iceberg	25
so even if	25
is a game	25
about in the	25
three blue balls	25
see a few	25
actually in the	25
it was easy	25
its the equivalent	25
look at other	25
and the united	25
four television programs	25
up in this	25
about the end	25
you that this	25
in its past	25
the nice thing	25
directly into the	25
use in the	25
have anything to	25
a mountain of	25
the amazing thing	25
throughout the country	25
is true that	25
to you now	25
thats what weve	25
i put in	25
like the way	25
right thing to	25
turing test for	25
to those people	25
and give you	25
more i play	25
answers to these	25
to solve these	25
life and the	25
you can probably	25
looking at these	25
the interests of	25
was the moment	25
on a personal	25
and pick up	25
people are very	25
it down to	25
across all of	25
the right direction	25
right side of	25
on the comet	25
way we do	25
of their neighbors	25
in on a	25
in an old	25
need to use	25
the question for	25
to have you	25
you think we	25
to play you	25
way is to	25
this has to	25
enables us to	25
should have a	25
of the carbon	25
his family and	25
bring people together	25
are very interested	25
a phd in	25
other people are	25
saw a lot	25
they can also	25
here you have	25
in any other	25
out by the	25
know if its	25
a human and	25
i was surprised	25
you about today	25
thing about it	25
push a button	25
on election day	25
because we all	25
it so you	25
have this kind	25
these people have	25
to imagine that	25
what the robot	25
because all of	25
of course you	25
of those two	25
getting in the	25
can tell the	25
of each of	25
is an incredibly	25
dont know whether	25
you can try	25
none of this	25
why we should	25
72 percent of	25
we managed to	25
so if the	25
the product of	25
that hum i	25
new set of	25
things about this	25
how we could	25
not be the	25
so powerful that	25
for over a	25
admit that we	25
thought it would	25
the width of	25
data from the	25
thats what they	25
you come to	25
trying to change	25
just like to	25
i have come	25
will see that	25
that i feel	25
ask a question	25
go up to	25
a small part	25
add up to	25
to be easy	25
if you say	25
going around the	25
is a photograph	25
with a bunch	25
she will not	25
of the spectrum	25
me with a	25
is to think	25
have to rely	25
of a living	25
the density of	25
the very thing	25
to this challenge	25
proved to be	25
every year in	25
when i told	25
for you you	25
to release the	25
production at a	25
they seem to	25
we all need	25
are the three	25
that the person	25
to explain this	25
just sort of	25
countries in africa	25
you to notice	25
happy to be	25
in that picture	25
used it to	25
a different perspective	25
that we share	25
and they even	25
is starting to	25
has ever seen	25
such a system	25
left and right	25
people this is	25
there was only	25
go back home	25
water from the	25
going to live	25
man who was	25
the mechanisms of	25
wish i could	25
us into the	25
how to live	25
know this because	25
but a few	25
is not alone	25
couldnt wait to	25
asked the question	25
you go down	25
worked in a	25
a talk about	25
do in this	25
the memory of	25
the benefit of	25
allowed me to	25
us it was	25
something that wasnt	25
what would we	25
we would do	25
looking at something	25
as i had	25
that they got	25
my mind i	25
of this stuff	25
the outcome of	25
see how we	25
week after week	25
first in the	25
dealing with this	25
the entire planet	25
would you have	25
the road and	25
two years of	25
trial and error	25
away with it	25
before and after	25
on the island	25
feel like youre	25
dont see it	25
to determine the	25
a place like	25
to so many	25
that theres something	25
are also the	25
below the surface	25
came out with	25
so now im	25
had not been	25
that can help	25
i did what	25
and the kind	25
why would i	25
expect to see	25
first time we	25
teach our kids	25
are associated with	25
we saw it	25
a friend who	25
have to own	25
interesting question is	25
even know what	25
you have any	25
brains and we	25
which brings me	25
it its not	25
who is in	25
even need to	25
maybe its a	25
they kind of	25
a problem that	25
and ill just	25
even at the	25
our brains and	25
here is my	25
what you were	25
of these animals	25
think most people	25
or it could	25
time when the	25
forces of nature	25
across the ocean	25
a problem for	25
and kind of	25
the architect of	25
deep sense of	25
being used in	25
for themselves and	25
with the ability	25
its a bad	25
story that we	25
papua new guinea	25
more than 90	25
weve seen in	25
power this is	25
we are more	25
of a computer	25
if you did	25
students in the	25
but as the	25
do for the	25
in both of	25
to answer this	25
this may be	25
have to invest	25
taken out of	25
it tries to	25
that weve created	25
because we will	25
problems that are	25
with my friends	25
in production at	25
the pace of	25
cool thing is	25
said he was	25
of the characters	25
i describe as	25
playing a game	25
the control of	25
like to end	25
and he also	25
there at the	25
theres a second	25
the job of	25
what you should	25
to say something	25
so here you	25
make better decisions	25
about things like	25
this brings me	25
of that i	25
the wrong question	25
they believe that	25
about the other	25
though it was	25
back to me	25
and you were	25
of all those	25
what have you	25
the computer in	25
a good place	25
they dont even	25
rather than being	25
and the women	25
would say to	25
where you get	25
would all be	25
im not even	25
search for life	25
and do something	25
have to build	25
of course they	25
of south america	25
heard about it	24
hand side of	24
where they can	24
very concerned about	24
do when they	24
designed to be	24
search for the	24
freedom of the	24
seeing the real	24
you used to	24
i was completely	24
so theres no	24
when we went	24
down to about	24
the data to	24
the energy of	24
do you need	24
get it back	24
then i had	24
there is now	24
top of this	24
to get me	24
have had the	24
is the face	24
spend so much	24
of the lhc	24
to go away	24
later on in	24
to the full	24
convince you that	24
of questions about	24
in a dark	24
about two million	24
so it doesnt	24
not being able	24
just showed you	24
you cant tell	24
to move the	24
to a small	24
middle of nowhere	24
to remember about	24
game of thrones	24
in developing countries	24
when this happens	24
were just a	24
you for the	24
that they should	24
is equal to	24
a small amount	24
say things like	24
is a terrible	24
had in my	24
that the technology	24
the proportion of	24
the lens of	24
because people are	24
where this is	24
power in the	24
learn so much	24
it can go	24
in the 1920s	24
start to make	24
but even if	24
a change in	24
one way of	24
search and rescue	24
to explain a	24
of this thing	24
i want my	24
because they will	24
so we put	24
the same number	24
that to a	24
for the second	24
by a factor	24
was to make	24
that was that	24
die drop it	24
at least for	24
you can talk	24
way of looking	24
by telling you	24
same as the	24
of all things	24
this and we	24
got a bit	24
thing to remember	24
so where does	24
my head and	24
wanted to leave	24
had become a	24
through the lens	24
if they wanted	24
come down to	24
the world health	24
imagine that youre	24
a future of	24
number of women	24
solve that problem	24
could make it	24
interested in science	24
it didnt work	24
might think about	24
not an easy	24
had a good	24
take the first	24
of global warming	24
try to explain	24
give me the	24
lots of other	24
it was built	24
this may sound	24
the future we	24
that point in	24
to argue that	24
with a camera	24
me one of	24
million miles away	24
time when i	24
in a network	24
a big difference	24
that theyll be	24
much faster than	24
without fossil fuels	24
this year and	24
and search for	24
you a very	24
under forest cover	24
ability to learn	24
the audience and	24
those two things	24
on how much	24
try not to	24
which is something	24
now working memory	24
was about a	24
i look back	24
this is such	24
and then its	24
not a great	24
in many different	24
kind of love	24
bunch of people	24
get integrated into	24
or it can	24
this time is	24
i created a	24
brother and i	24
here is how	24
i think all	24
if they have	24
that i never	24
had a long	24
rich and powerful	24
but youre not	24
at the way	24
so whats the	24
or on the	24
you will know	24
of time to	24
when the sun	24
of the three	24
supercharged carbon recyclers	24
do need to	24
i was watching	24
inside of this	24
out in a	24
i got into	24
kind of technology	24
you all have	24
camera and on	24
the dream of	24
can see on	24
talking about and	24
for some time	24
take it to	24
first thing is	24
the door to	24
i mean a	24
to that and	24
and it means	24
even though he	24
going in the	24
to be wrong	24
and last year	24
world health organization	24
have so many	24
if you knew	24
i do i	24
of money is	24
is what a	24
a very hard	24
and tell them	24
the trust stack	24
most likely to	24
is so strong	24
never would have	24
with the technology	24
on facebook and	24
the formula for	24
we think is	24
about the time	24
a force for	24
can do all	24
could change the	24
my point of	24
you die drop	24
in this direction	24
at this and	24
to manage the	24
we change the	24
how much energy	24
a shift in	24
that doesnt work	24
in all these	24
didnt know we	24
we just cant	24
you see what	24
enough money to	24
we try and	24
the dark playground	24
is that im	24
than one billion	24
its really not	24
asked me what	24
very important in	24
we lived in	24
a sign that	24
here for a	24
in and on	24
hope that you	24
find out the	24
they didnt even	24
you give the	24
people who live	24
want to suggest	24
its impossible to	24
the brain activity	24
so not only	24
people who care	24
need to put	24
know that im	24
that the brains	24
us with a	24
i am and	24
i did with	24
happens to us	24
hundreds of people	24
not that hard	24
to go home	24
when i do	24
of the market	24
which i found	24
be in that	24
then we would	24
of science fiction	24
more time with	24
now that the	24
they use to	24
to remind us	24
the science and	24
to pay the	24
is looking for	24
the night and	24
much more efficient	24
the whole time	24
i went up	24
on the boat	24
them with the	24
image on the	24
all different kinds	24
and my dad	24
a problem when	24
like we were	24
sound of a	24
should we do	24
our children are	24
they made a	24
and the ability	24
the large hadron	24
today we are	24
have to move	24
again this is	24
very happy with	24
and what weve	24
say to the	24
to step back	24
the last 40	24
through the plant	24
the will to	24
believe that there	24
they thought they	24
its an important	24
so some of	24
hives of bees	24
when i read	24
you wake up	24
are they know	24
us if we	24
of times per	24
to people that	24
of san francisco	24
from the middle	24
of a much	24
the 18th century	24
the same that	24
this planet is	24
have a right	24
in many of	24
and a woman	24
you do is	24
companies in the	24
the person that	24
people a year	24
these are very	24
here i have	24
have some of	24
wanted to talk	24
even if the	24
because i just	24
and im also	24
been called the	24
you a lot	24
if you actually	24
the people with	24
we have of	24
day and i	24
have been found	24
and listen to	24
deal with it	24
what i didnt	24
we have with	24
especially when you	24
would it look	24
places like the	24
also means that	24
i know they	24
you change the	24
and the audience	24
if one of	24
see them in	24
that i got	24
couple of questions	24
think i would	24
do it right	24
ive ever had	24
on some of	24
was a way	24
us this is	24
which i have	24
team and i	24
smaller and smaller	24
have a friend	24
to the challenge	24
on the west	24
interacting with the	24
this particular one	24
is the picture	24
says to me	24
you should do	24
so of course	24
there should be	24
n y cajal	24
of us has	24
i was excited	24
in the spring	24
taking place in	24
that women have	24
to you as	24
they are our	24
which is so	24
with which we	24
a huge impact	24
i put the	24
happen if we	24
by the year	24
sense to be	24
common ground and	24
your body and	24
is a fantastic	24
kind of get	24
the hard work	24
happens to the	24
how much money	24
chance to get	24
in which case	24
of mine who	24
of the movie	24
i was starting	24
to lower uncertainty	24
just by the	24
these are two	24
happened to the	24
we hope that	24
with the best	24
of the job	24
asked a question	24
will no longer	24
is like this	24
the past of	24
comes to mind	24
and as an	24
in common with	24
show you something	24
to all these	24
you ever been	24
were designed to	24
care about our	24
an understanding of	24
it but what	24
what is called	24
to fall in	24
they were just	24
what could be	24
one has ever	24
your ability to	24
in a book	24
a letter to	24
i cannot tell	24
can understand that	24
a trust leap	24
times per day	24
stood up and	24
but they can	24
ive ever met	24
i finally got	24
in different parts	24
not the other	24
can actually be	24
out that this	24
same time i	24
to make my	24
is something called	24
going to represent	24
slow down the	24
human being is	24
taken by the	24
so we didnt	24
in the 50s	24
what to think	24
theory of the	24
researchers found that	24
the next couple	24
i dont remember	24
people who seem	24
is not always	24
need to encourage	24
so lets talk	24
to another country	24
you hear it	24
to have something	24
the pattern of	24
and its like	24
my first job	24
it isnt just	24
in the near	24
to use my	24
a device that	24
men of the	24
these people were	24
do the job	24
because its so	24
color in the	24
world we live	24
which is kind	24
that as well	24
whether it was	24
20 years of	24
at least some	24
that other people	24
after the first	24
here i was	24
for that we	24
it at all	24
the air but	24
seem to have	24
so after a	24
way in the	24
and then eventually	24
friends and i	24
the moment where	24
to look back	24
different ways to	24
put on my	24
thats why were	24
that the number	24
will be different	24
the very least	24
story to tell	24
the urge to	24
like what you	24
to partner with	24
its not true	24
these small robots	24
are here to	24
and began to	24
in a situation	24
but we still	24
to create and	24
lost in the	24
from one place	24
the black hole	24
that turns out	24
began to see	24
in my career	24
in prison for	24
to go around	24
realize is that	24
know some of	24
in this area	24
hold on to	24
a life that	24
we should just	24
right now we	24
trying to say	24
for what they	24
the decision to	24
the sounds of	24
but i found	24
bit of time	24
was that he	24
princess leia merchandise	24
came to this	24
doesnt know how	24
we have any	24
if its the	24
people have done	24
it difficult to	24
a fan of	24
more like the	24
we have it	24
this a new	24
it does this	24
and to our	24
not just with	24
dont know whats	24
ones and the	24
other people to	24
happen in a	24
and they took	24
the status of	24
this works is	24
that were listening	24
im not the	24
the case is	24
but it really	24
will allow us	24
at things like	24
these animals are	24
theres a difference	24
i know some	24
try to keep	24
works like a	24
has now been	24
happening on the	24
the west coast	24
to let you	24
knowledge of the	24
im not an	24
but they still	24
we can save	24
has been on	24
waste of time	24
instant gratification monkey	24
might be happening	24
systems in the	24
to prove that	24
to explain that	24
that tries to	24
if youre lucky	24
ive been in	24
the periodic table	24
that humans are	24
been doing it	24
come up and	24
cost of the	24
that all these	24
amount of water	24
but that wasnt	24
start to get	24
a national park	24
wanted to try	24
only a small	24
at me with	24
theyre supposed to	24
the goal of	24
dont think of	24
my husband and	24
a little paper	24
the culture of	24
united states is	24
would take a	24
system that we	24
in the power	24
them if they	24
on my first	24
and theyre really	24
our brain is	24
this comes from	24
you about some	24
i was getting	24
of our children	24
you get something	24
but the reason	24
we can imagine	24
may be wondering	24
i put a	24
a message from	24
on a friday	24
working memory is	24
see an image	24
to tell this	24
out of three	24
work for the	24
them at all	24
the west bank	24
in a brain	24
each other when	24
the book is	24
once we know	24
of the videos	24
are many other	24
get all of	24
even as a	24
also look at	24
more than 2	24
way of being	24
the ios of	24
might start to	24
the second question	24
listen to these	24
feel the same	24
you with this	24
because of climate	24
height of the	24
wanted to take	24
times stronger than	24
great example of	24
is not as	24
person or persons	24
12 years ago	24
put it to	24
a moral imperative	24
i want a	24
can make that	24
in these places	24
they are able	24
had a huge	24
stories of the	24
used to manufacture	24
and i loved	24
in their eyes	24
and so for	24
of our species	24
and the left	24
lay their eggs	24
ios of the	24
and some other	24
bunch of other	24
to that point	24
who killed bin	24
a world war	24
if theyre not	24
stuck with me	24
this a little	24
from the university	24
you give people	24
tree of life	24
you work with	24
are not that	24
think it would	24
same time as	24
on our hands	24
of creating a	24
people interested in	24
the country to	24
these computers are	24
i put them	24
to raise my	24
scale to meet	24
me start with	24
a hole in	24
deep learning algorithm	24
years in prison	24
of you probably	24
we are actually	24
thoughts and feelings	24
over a million	24
the guide rna	24
put on a	24
that from the	24
we have nothing	24
i do and	24
you find is	24
were much more	24
what was that	24
be afraid of	24
body and the	24
is a simple	24
age of reason	24
who lives in	24
in other parts	24
you dont hear	24
doesnt need to	24
to protect us	24
are very good	24
shown that the	24
a lot from	24
to arts and	24
and how many	24
more in the	24
you can now	24
in the project	24
exactly what it	24
world and what	24
the political sphere	24
of religion and	24
than a human	24
we go out	24
you about what	24
now i dont	24
ability to change	24
to know is	24
we turn to	24
how the world	24
we already know	24
back in a	24
i must say	24
they have their	24
like to leave	24
another human being	24
and like all	24
you dont believe	24
20 or 30	24
them so they	24
and thank you	24
of the cold	24
by the us	24
the wrong way	24
to protect their	24
were a kid	24
made that decision	24
in the womb	24
at the core	24
is an actual	24
was created by	24
say that it	24
in a school	24
know how it	24
why is there	24
it goes on	24
ig nobel prize	24
started a company	24
our body and	24
10 times as	24
to another and	24
its almost like	24
lower our uncertainties	24
not to get	24
to care for	24
thank you all	24
are there so	24
actually not that	24
so this means	24
and we decided	24
these robots are	24
context of a	24
stuff like that	24
where to go	24
helping us to	24
means we can	24
want to enhance	24
think of these	24
of a better	24
the fabric of	24
all of his	24
the indian ocean	24
to some extent	24
does it feel	24
so it has	24
for a month	24
thing that happens	24
stand up for	24
i was 18	24
how they can	24
percentage of the	24
is of course	24
we took this	24
dollars a day	24
off from the	24
would tell you	24
ability will have	24
people in my	24
vast amounts of	24
they said that	24
my eyes and	24
whats happening is	24
why does it	24
to you i	24
doing that for	24
water in the	24
about the history	24
the southern ocean	24
see it every	24
theres more in	23
you have heard	23
we have learned	23
one in which	23
about trying to	23
people started to	23
of how many	23
is involved in	23
you that its	23
it reminds me	23
folks who are	23
that occur in	23
i find that	23
by the fact	23
rest of it	23
days a week	23
we do now	23
and are you	23
and now there	23
we may find	23
on the face	23
not based on	23
and my colleagues	23
that i went	23
begin to understand	23
so great that	23
walk out of	23
just a quick	23
be found in	23
work together and	23
come back in	23
to extend our	23
directly to the	23
know the story	23
earth is going	23
a hundred times	23
to the site	23
just the way	23
that data is	23
by a few	23
we spend so	23
think its time	23
me want to	23
when it doesnt	23
i dont give	23
and thats all	23
of what he	23
myself in a	23
the door and	23
water on the	23
its also about	23
which of course	23
when we say	23
the possibility that	23
soon as possible	23
it could happen	23
but that didnt	23
my father and	23
and they never	23
world where the	23
a man and	23
i started writing	23
both men and	23
im not really	23
i can give	23
be the perfect	23
at all so	23
of this that	23
to be creative	23
it is normal	23
question that i	23
when i met	23
to say a	23
take control of	23
but right now	23
and get them	23
were the same	23
this over and	23
out there on	23
you are seeing	23
trying to show	23
with more than	23
lot of data	23
really change the	23
be hard to	23
we work on	23
are ready to	23
and it went	23
we can extract	23
concept of a	23
into it and	23
important in the	23
still a lot	23
know why they	23
the main character	23
is an important	23
to give him	23
the wall street	23
is the mother	23
what makes it	23
we put all	23
but the one	23
to show off	23
to tell stories	23
about it its	23
home in the	23
equivalent of a	23
a book and	23
i wish that	23
in other ways	23
000 dollars a	23
and she told	23
of weeks ago	23
light in the	23
can show you	23
hes one of	23
last year in	23
do not think	23
with him and	23
next 15 years	23
very likely that	23
about this project	23
that says that	23
see is a	23
to see some	23
the virtual world	23
not been able	23
we learn about	23
where does this	23
of dollars in	23
thats what ive	23
gave you a	23
i still remember	23
are right now	23
team of researchers	23
i really dont	23
to explain the	23
its always been	23
found that we	23
like to start	23
the world when	23
and how does	23
the statistics of	23
we are talking	23
and given the	23
know that these	23
what goes on	23
doing right now	23
i knew what	23
hes got a	23
he was so	23
do it by	23
think all of	23
is that for	23
is the ability	23
go to one	23
gets into the	23
the motor cortex	23
in the political	23
on a regular	23
she was in	23
a professor at	23
heres another one	23
has been my	23
that to be	23
the power that	23
about 30 percent	23
the game was	23
for 50 years	23
to explain it	23
important to us	23
you want this	23
that are much	23
that dont have	23
answer this question	23
be even more	23
get up and	23
happening is that	23
just talked about	23
the actions of	23
a human brain	23
the most sophisticated	23
for just a	23
ask them to	23
to the office	23
in new orleans	23
are many more	23
us to use	23
and then put	23
not what we	23
miles away and	23
we can try	23
what this tells	23
of what youre	23
a whole range	23
you that it	23
of the team	23
lot of this	23
is the single	23
no longer be	23
change how we	23
then all of	23
to work so	23
as someone who	23
when you come	23
lose faith in	23
i had all	23
need to build	23
to their own	23
were to go	23
like to give	23
a history of	23
when i get	23
order to help	23
do was to	23
because we might	23
or if you	23
let me first	23
be a bit	23
it will just	23
than if you	23
what went wrong	23
on his head	23
to be working	23
excited about the	23
architecture of the	23
because they need	23
thats the same	23
and as youll	23
he and his	23
put this in	23
of things in	23
are at least	23
almost impossible to	23
all in this	23
let me put	23
that we look	23
be just a	23
the ones i	23
i know there	23
about a hundred	23
and so with	23
do the things	23
things that might	23
be so much	23
need to move	23
drive down the	23
as a means	23
why would they	23
up to that	23
the top 10	23
and everybody else	23
can go from	23
the intersection of	23
as you would	23
we get people	23
that these were	23
other thing is	23
found out about	23
long history of	23
it in this	23
is not new	23
we work in	23
and do a	23
they do not	23
will take a	23
in one way	23
to move around	23
times faster than	23
up and they	23
happens in a	23
at different times	23
you guessed it	23
is no such	23
are doing a	23
and why we	23
time they were	23
find a cure	23
has changed the	23
despite all the	23
like the sun	23
humans can do	23
have to show	23
are not in	23
a big fan	23
out how much	23
i thought was	23
see here the	23
put up with	23
that my father	23
you look back	23
what he meant	23
i just couldnt	23
is caused by	23
they looked at	23
the minister of	23
the early 1900s	23
do in a	23
by the most	23
come and go	23
this to be	23
right to be	23
you just go	23
that it will	23
life is not	23
do as a	23
use that to	23
during that time	23
when we feel	23
ive been there	23
wanted you to	23
chance to go	23
to do better	23
the needle and	23
second thing is	23
this stuff and	23
the border of	23
tell you something	23
just the tip	23
hows it going	23
in our universe	23
take on the	23
for an hour	23
this process of	23
to hit the	23
believe this is	23
with something that	23
of things you	23
theres only a	23
dont even need	23
lot like the	23
here is one	23
whats the use	23
you what you	23
that thats a	23
to that question	23
red blood cells	23
go and look	23
of reasons why	23
make us feel	23
time for a	23
see here in	23
we are putting	23
the new world	23
are things we	23
what they have	23
are on a	23
and do it	23
than all of	23
me to play	23
of the size	23
do that we	23
to the market	23
the millions of	23
like this the	23
and my personal	23
from the right	23
she was going	23
i was part	23
women and girls	23
we actually can	23
it so this	23
year of the	23
in the social	23
just like me	23
the second reason	23
in this study	23
about how were	23
way we used	23
they just dont	23
not really a	23
that was no	23
then a few	23
you could make	23
the scientific literature	23
and we find	23
its probably not	23
our responsibility to	23
the computer to	23
of the experience	23
is the difference	23
as possible so	23
and i call	23
the job done	23
doing is taking	23
left or right	23
like many of	23
lot more people	23
for the better	23
theory is that	23
when we actually	23
of different types	23
and you ask	23
every day i	23
you dont think	23
myself as a	23
listening to this	23
really is the	23
of real estate	23
through the whole	23
lot of sense	23
it that i	23
had the chance	23
in computer science	23
in the light	23
next to a	23
and the moon	23
even though its	23
one thing thats	23
that you all	23
occurred to me	23
that you just	23
fruits and vegetables	23
things that can	23
half of our	23
if theres one	23
whats happening here	23
can see an	23
the future to	23
the other reason	23
we learn from	23
you put the	23
think and feel	23
same thing as	23
the economic and	23
you what that	23
side of a	23
our place in	23
the middle class	23
this work is	23
all these years	23
in the picture	23
we actually dont	23
for all sorts	23
a very famous	23
the flip side	23
also see that	23
an early age	23
to see whats	23
know about other	23
to make me	23
he asked me	23
youre not allowed	23
back to your	23
as a family	23
the child is	23
that she can	23
was five years	23
difference between a	23
last 30 years	23
we had was	23
what would the	23
as they get	23
about a lot	23
we get our	23
my own face	23
leads to the	23
but also a	23
it gave me	23
located in the	23
would i be	23
it a bit	23
they were getting	23
to work i	23
which was very	23
in my pocket	23
get you to	23
and it feels	23
the place that	23
and in all	23
the real deal	23
can also use	23
are doing the	23
to them i	23
the past 15	23
million dollars in	23
i wonder what	23
on a journey	23
a loss of	23
out of its	23
when i dont	23
so i picked	23
we learn to	23
you get some	23
be better than	23
only one who	23
of a bird	23
very much like	23
rest of their	23
so on but	23
you ask them	23
of the person	23
why are they	23
which one of	23
soon as you	23
but i wont	23
light years away	23
human beings in	23
two weeks later	23
thing i wanted	23
a body of	23
ive never met	23
a year to	23
humans and robots	23
these people in	23
era of the	23
of the box	23
think that there	23
theres still a	23
a hundred million	23
it happened in	23
whether its a	23
so that its	23
things that humans	23
as i got	23
with hundreds of	23
to take to	23
which they are	23
the architecture of	23
i gave my	23
would come to	23
you create a	23
i got up	23
could no longer	23
of the land	23
is a guy	23
if i tell	23
this you can	23
theres a couple	23
the future so	23
to that is	23
that feeling of	23
until i was	23
the dark energy	23
maybe some of	23
let it go	23
up and up	23
i am very	23
of the one	23
a tool for	23
is what happened	23
our hands and	23
this in my	23
what makes me	23
him in the	23
know how the	23
good and evil	23
can we have	23
picture of it	23
that because it	23
thats more than	23
a black woman	23
tell her the	23
and its that	23
late in the	23
me this is	23
on the subject	23
a few generations	23
i showed up	23
of the light	23
can be an	23
to stand in	23
is really quite	23
i read a	23
integral part of	23
many people as	23
an expert on	23
but not the	23
well have to	23
more than an	23
to spend time	23
was the one	23
of information about	23
can do better	23
inside of me	23
to know a	23
start to look	23
respond to the	23
of these guys	23
able to work	23
that we create	23
to the rule	23
is how long	23
to increase the	23
talk about my	23
the company that	23
the cancer cell	23
an email from	23
a totally new	23
you how this	23
the animals that	23
are telling us	23
oh my gosh	23
business as usual	23
what has happened	23
of the students	23
i understood that	23
does that have	23
the important point	23
took place in	23
but even with	23
the table and	23
with the rise	23
hour of the	23
let me introduce	23
and you realize	23
united states in	23
we did so	23
do so in	23
can we use	23
that youre not	23
out there was	23
human beings and	23
the only animals	23
do it all	23
you can almost	23
i need a	23
they would come	23
to land on	23
of the tasks	23
but is that	23
there had been	23
shown here in	23
in our lifetimes	23
them this is	23
is where were	23
and its time	23
think they have	23
really care about	23
it gives me	23
i would choose	23
open up a	23
those who dont	23
to achieve this	23
have an idea	23
like the united	23
by virtue of	23
realized that we	23
i got out	23
different way of	23
one in three	23
afraid of the	23
that those are	23
energy that we	23
and went to	23
and then two	23
the process and	23
some people have	23
so what would	23
take them out	23
percent more than	23
of my head	23
in war zones	23
be looking at	23
is because you	23
a time where	23
during that period	23
to you if	23
the neural network	23
other people can	23
in his life	23
years old the	23
working with these	23
that i work	23
up to them	23
us on the	23
have been with	23
has given us	23
our children and	23
good for you	23
to the edges	23
your friends and	23
i take the	23
this was all	23
due to a	23
have an opportunity	23
climate change in	23
region of the	23
play a video	23
to take advantage	23
fear of failure	23
bring them to	23
in a straight	23
worked as a	23
it through a	23
had a really	23
if im going	23
were no longer	23
this room and	23
that we learned	23
something that the	23
only animals that	23
that it needs	23
weve had a	23
weve done a	23
look out for	23
yourself in the	23
was that this	23
you out of	23
we just give	23
hard to make	23
based on what	23
is related to	23
what we mean	23
on the brain	23
it and it	23
to capture the	23
you would not	23
theres a reason	23
we saw in	23
kind of what	23
but at least	23
of the web	23
in need of	23
were really good	23
we could find	23
an integral part	23
to look up	23
young and old	23
me because i	23
could figure out	23
color of the	23
but we want	23
have to pay	23
which we all	23
a bit about	23
them and to	23
you make the	23
lets do it	23
that was done	23
look the same	23
going to lead	23
have tried to	23
we are creating	23
some things that	23
step is to	23
and lo and	23
i was standing	23
know what we	23
the way its	23
ways to do	23
on the vertical	23
from the human	23
the impacts of	23
were ready to	23
much as possible	23
the code is	23
seen in the	23
and i thank	23
and come back	23
a new particle	23
it is more	23
the year of	23
with the new	23
and a new	23
was something really	23
do that so	23
because i thought	23
to discover that	23
its actually not	23
with that and	23
just part of	23
interact with each	23
on wall street	23
turn into a	23
there are risks	23
see this is	23
works is that	23
us who we	23
made a difference	23
with a great	23
can sort of	23
so now that	23
they could see	23
and the black	23
power that we	23
the immune system	23
how to move	23
doing the work	23
i show you	23
the action is	23
there i was	23
to be open	23
theres a way	23
that had never	23
three years of	23
to the number	23
in this space	23
if it does	23
close to a	23
is it the	23
a mobile phone	23
piece by piece	23
if you took	23
had time to	23
never seen a	23
but we did	23
you know you	23
traumatic stress disorder	23
what intelligence is	23
it could have	23
or maybe its	23
realize that this	23
can change our	23
and much of	23
in the atlantic	23
is a high	23
you go home	23
they get the	23
we found one	23
to get started	23
at the most	23
in our culture	23
my mom and	23
face of a	23
you didnt know	23
at how we	23
thing that they	23
who believe that	23
is the other	23
have not yet	23
right around the	23
the right hand	23
is becoming a	23
we worked with	23
you know its	23
because they thought	23
want to convince	23
be very clear	23
turn of the	23
grow up in	23
were asking questions	23
the technology is	23
theres no doubt	23
hope that we	23
right now there	23
responsible for the	23
out what to	23
have done this	23
and its my	23
so that a	23
but also because	23
i said yes	23
way to solve	23
and then people	23
the right one	23
thing called the	22
on and off	22
out of these	22
so i put	22
back to their	22
way that were	22
how much time	22
has got to	22
me i had	22
of what happens	22
theres no such	22
had come to	22
hes about to	22
my point is	22
the interest of	22
be a way	22
is not easy	22
to change and	22
will actually be	22
000 miles away	22
work of the	22
it at a	22
in trying to	22
into space and	22
of going to	22
this whole thing	22
door to door	22
the us alone	22
you choose to	22
would change the	22
is not true	22
and that this	22
had was a	22
on the market	22
that day was	22
it all over	22
theyre in a	22
and my mother	22
is that youre	22
to step into	22
what they wanted	22
what we actually	22
out if we	22
is to tell	22
was developed by	22
the right age	22
and thats very	22
were very excited	22
it in that	22
it is true	22
even when the	22
certain types of	22
you got it	22
to imagine what	22
who do you	22
research has shown	22
when i would	22
in the medical	22
to build on	22
and our kids	22
could talk about	22
be happy to	22
and putting it	22
im supposed to	22
problem is its	22
like to speak	22
consider that the	22
do that now	22
dont see the	22
some sense of	22
much so that	22
piece of land	22
and this will	22
to be afraid	22
i suddenly realized	22
what i realized	22
thats the point	22
its not necessarily	22
more work to	22
the financial industry	22
so i wouldnt	22
know if i	22
you is a	22
had grown up	22
the grocery store	22
not good at	22
short period of	22
of that was	22
is a part	22
i read this	22
build a society	22
not that many	22
with only one	22
do we build	22
i spoke to	22
no way that	22
and were now	22
and we came	22
what actually happened	22
to get and	22
the way things	22
of the curve	22
anything about it	22
almost as if	22
im talking to	22
what have i	22
so thats exactly	22
i asked you	22
as it does	22
across the arab	22
each other but	22
this ted talk	22
leads us to	22
this feeling of	22
the fourth and	22
we get that	22
and climate change	22
as a person	22
what if instead	22
together with a	22
wash their hands	22
into the hands	22
people like that	22
next to her	22
i look for	22
because were not	22
i know who	22
that into a	22
people who do	22
spend the next	22
to have any	22
now at the	22
only one thing	22
ones who have	22
is an interesting	22
and to give	22
were not only	22
and people who	22
i asked the	22
different ways that	22
down and so	22
the author of	22
do we really	22
it didnt matter	22
in nature and	22
into the classroom	22
to use your	22
into the stratosphere	22
your body to	22
and a whole	22
a better understanding	22
shows that the	22
bigger than that	22
about those things	22
not because i	22
able to watch	22
zoom in to	22
it back in	22
much more powerful	22
i could say	22
this because we	22
it again and	22
on my way	22
the human is	22
the most critical	22
growing on the	22
i did that	22
and he just	22
the very nature	22
problem with the	22
so many women	22
of the ice	22
people who work	22
like this when	22
and our own	22
the year before	22
as you are	22
and started to	22
ourselves and our	22
obsessed with the	22
in my book	22
that he can	22
is going down	22
try and find	22
here he is	22
we take it	22
to be willing	22
it would become	22
the atlantic ocean	22
a problem and	22
about to be	22
try to put	22
and the cool	22
so in that	22
idea that i	22
with you some	22
this isnt just	22
make a ted	22
that doesnt know	22
do you mean	22
it looks a	22
how i could	22
depends on how	22
is coming from	22
we manage our	22
lot of new	22
on things like	22
ill try to	22
do you make	22
what we learn	22
you see an	22
was clear that	22
that are actually	22
the question we	22
after years of	22
but why is	22
well and good	22
when my daughter	22
and thats one	22
the community of	22
the plant and	22
something of a	22
think about these	22
in the state	22
at the base	22
not for the	22
that the whole	22
let me go	22
this moment in	22
that comes with	22
about 40 percent	22
spent most of	22
it was clear	22
there is actually	22
you could bring	22
in india and	22
do at the	22
for a whole	22
you take that	22
very proud of	22
sources of information	22
i bet you	22
can use these	22
wanted to look	22
the first year	22
did is i	22
on a beach	22
you send a	22
be a big	22
and people in	22
a tiny little	22
but it just	22
takes a long	22
you hear somebody	22
in the constitution	22
dont care about	22
we are already	22
two months later	22
to step up	22
it is we	22
you with one	22
together and i	22
diversity of the	22
of the young	22
so they were	22
give a damn	22
to high school	22
are similar to	22
to my office	22
reminds us that	22
our own bodies	22
used in a	22
the outskirts of	22
can find out	22
the thought of	22
look at something	22
thats really the	22
edge of a	22
can do any	22
of pollen that	22
been working with	22
and i ended	22
have to reach	22
no one would	22
from the surface	22
i cant think	22
was a part	22
in the search	22
in this building	22
you get more	22
dont know it	22
the right brain	22
the technology thats	22
if we put	22
would you feel	22
at the cost	22
its really cool	22
the wright brothers	22
i use my	22
shoulder to shoulder	22
was there a	22
world and we	22
that if it	22
the stone age	22
didnt get it	22
live our lives	22
has a unique	22
take the time	22
to share this	22
know what were	22
to imagine a	22
see how this	22
in a number	22
the human experience	22
care about this	22
a machine can	22
so easy to	22
been a long	22
of the pacific	22
is important because	22
affects all of	22
that you never	22
are not alone	22
take you through	22
i made that	22
length of time	22
world to the	22
and they must	22
that when he	22
in that community	22
the first people	22
the water is	22
to put up	22
the game and	22
a little like	22
a woman in	22
is a man	22
for a job	22
and the system	22
how difficult it	22
the nest maintenance	22
the whole population	22
is the biggest	22
there are these	22
you learn that	22
a criminal record	22
in the garden	22
also able to	22
we need people	22
the first problem	22
long story short	22
the dark side	22
is to put	22
years of life	22
giving up on	22
able to match	22
is a completely	22
says that if	22
and then all	22
cant think of	22
a position to	22
hundreds and thousands	22
a damn about	22
it is something	22
the last four	22
not what i	22
we didnt even	22
knew i was	22
was on my	22
have a bit	22
awareness of the	22
how we act	22
everything that was	22
to those of	22
person on the	22
what was i	22
not thinking about	22
as it happens	22
this is taken	22
life of the	22
so i guess	22
and i cannot	22
with just one	22
the spring of	22
the streets in	22
the data is	22
and he did	22
about the kinds	22
we had done	22
was used to	22
food and water	22
a job in	22
is to actually	22
they were saying	22
have plenty of	22
only does it	22
hundreds of billions	22
difficult it is	22
and there have	22
their sense of	22
but i got	22
moves through the	22
of you as	22
just because i	22
should think about	22
you about how	22
the earth was	22
is to develop	22
they not only	22
single person in	22
that i actually	22
and so to	22
think that theres	22
a huge problem	22
much of my	22
why did we	22
just had to	22
because the brain	22
we were both	22
it gets to	22
important role in	22
at a few	22
so they have	22
did it was	22
and his friends	22
not very much	22
about the past	22
them around the	22
i know about	22
you are conscious	22
in slow motion	22
in common is	22
here to the	22
and i walked	22
theyre on the	22
the advent of	22
are engaged in	22
can be more	22
the lower left	22
they were using	22
is changing the	22
thats when the	22
of them we	22
you get there	22
so many times	22
the fears that	22
of it the	22
and the tools	22
we did with	22
sitting on a	22
within the brain	22
in which were	22
in a whole	22
about to do	22
a company to	22
of people like	22
believe we are	22
actually a very	22
the characteristics of	22
figure that out	22
kinds of different	22
that i need	22
10 years and	22
where are they	22
and how can	22
it is all	22
and its in	22
for our children	22
we went through	22
differences in the	22
to be their	22
in the sand	22
about this in	22
that will help	22
had to give	22
the worlds greatest	22
lot about what	22
can be really	22
much to do	22
and learn about	22
left side of	22
is that each	22
can have an	22
and we didnt	22
in our countries	22
that the united	22
on a small	22
we want and	22
you dont really	22
and thats an	22
be at least	22
because we found	22
for about two	22
we now call	22
a very popular	22
the left of	22
looking for is	22
answers to the	22
have seen this	22
to play it	22
never forget the	22
they call it	22
what kinds of	22
im afraid to	22
of the clean	22
ten years ago	22
of the white	22
and all those	22
last three years	22
there is such	22
so much in	22
a short time	22
but what they	22
used by the	22
this idea is	22
and beyond that	22
start in the	22
source of information	22
you buy a	22
sure some of	22
10 times more	22
learn from the	22
the other people	22
a better job	22
and now they	22
so one day	22
you had the	22
thought i could	22
more than 80	22
on that one	22
or tens of	22
been to the	22
thing you have	22
why didnt i	22
study found that	22
if you record	22
second is that	22
not think that	22
people with high	22
ahead of time	22
that he is	22
take on a	22
more than four	22
then theres a	22
well as other	22
should have to	22
able to detect	22
just one example	22
up and the	22
the failure of	22
even more importantly	22
science of consciousness	22
seems like the	22
never had a	22
know that that	22
to hide the	22
where theres no	22
the real question	22
when he said	22
have a robot	22
united states to	22
is not like	22
like each other	22
the fossil record	22
enough to do	22
make all of	22
and they came	22
but in any	22
so it would	22
we can only	22
the challenge of	22
and which is	22
in that sense	22
it is like	22
how we use	22
play the game	22
that were looking	22
last 40 years	22
interested in how	22
it depends on	22
a cheese sandwich	22
has found a	22
in a movie	22
about this for	22
question of how	22
all know what	22
able to communicate	22
and so at	22
and so as	22
now what is	22
something to be	22
to take some	22
every day its	22
just to be	22
sides of the	22
in so doing	22
the corpus callosum	22
im a journalist	22
to the entire	22
the death of	22
say a word	22
you in that	22
we thought we	22
so ill just	22
i saw it	22
he was talking	22
is meant to	22
take the risk	22
a man in	22
its a fantastic	22
our young people	22
reason is because	22
right and left	22
i have done	22
in school and	22
to be to	22
giving them a	22
up on this	22
not easy to	22
out whats going	22
when they say	22
im really excited	22
this was really	22
and so is	22
maybe it was	22
i hope youll	22
a day to	22
can do more	22
i got all	22
been a huge	22
dont mean that	22
is when i	22
our need for	22
with a long	22
see what i	22
fossil fuels for	22
a kid in	22
to make predictions	22
but for many	22
work for a	22
and it changed	22
world who are	22
just on the	22
on the website	22
about how i	22
something very different	22
to replicate the	22
order for us	22
to stay on	22
front of it	22
as it were	22
will be on	22
something to the	22
try and do	22
having to do	22
data this is	22
considered to be	22
im so happy	22
of this story	22
the most basic	22
husband and i	22
is a person	22
when we had	22
now think about	22
now to the	22
this is good	22
was living in	22
wanted to share	22
addition to that	22
really see the	22
to pull the	22
but i like	22
you something about	22
end up being	22
to find it	22
are some examples	22
of information to	22
are people in	22
point where we	22
to show their	22
us a little	22
love and the	22
particles in the	22
was quite a	22
whether its the	22
and a very	22
having an affair	22
understand how we	22
in this process	22
on earth are	22
us think about	22
of the extra	22
can tell me	22
that are all	22
i found was	22
the last 200	22
and he wants	22
our world and	22
could go on	22
was out of	22
to people in	22
behind closed doors	22
was done by	22
and then that	22
that must be	22
what can be	22
to build something	22
oil and gas	22
job in the	22
or a small	22
how am i	22
about the people	22
their brains and	22
reason to believe	22
theres always a	22
and so theres	22
started to think	22
their own governments	22
join me in	22
and because i	22
may or may	22
at a local	22
and where you	22
feel like the	22
i went there	22
like to build	22
the streets and	22
some people think	22
want to call	22
see some of	22
about this idea	22
more than i	22
i can look	22
walking down the	22
of his own	22
and we start	22
so its the	22
will look back	22
you like the	22
thanks a lot	22
was a child	22
is very close	22
people like you	22
my country and	22
but we knew	22
long enough to	22
turning it into	22
is similar to	22
about the need	22
that when were	22
if we cant	22
will help you	22
because youre not	22
in places where	22
and not have	22
of people think	22
this room who	22
to my surprise	22
go to university	22
and it determines	22
a generation that	22
a single organism	22
on your left	22
the root of	22
in the cities	22
this is this	22
the present day	22
a pattern of	22
or may not	22
i couldnt wait	22
i just dont	22
into a world	22
she was just	22
it take to	22
on the topic	22
can actually do	22
where there were	22
i look forward	22
theres nothing wrong	22
sort of stuff	22
the main point	22
think that is	22
comes in and	22
was in my	22
and just the	22
started to have	22
see that there	22
i spoke about	22
this notion of	22
and as he	22
a quote from	22
about half the	22
spend some time	22
years after that	22
community of people	22
for me its	22
set of rules	22
power of this	22
see in a	22
tend to have	22
very smart people	22
to show it	22
are at risk	22
is a much	22
of three billion	22
like a little	22
last 200 years	22
my friend and	22
founder of the	22
to the developing	22
many different types	22
same with a	22
in the fact	22
now one of	22
the scope of	22
we do so	22
who knows what	22
and im here	22
we have done	22
next thing we	22
leader of the	22
to present to	22
as an adult	22
there to make	22
just that the	22
going to sit	22
there a way	22
he didnt want	22
started as a	22
in all directions	22
of different ways	22
something similar to	22
that each of	22
the late 1980s	22
i remember one	22
amazing to me	22
the soil is	22
the problems with	22
him and i	22
this i mean	22
and something that	22
but we should	22
beyond our own	22
just for a	22
when people have	22
will come to	22
threat to the	22
until you realize	22
a developing country	22
to move it	22
im an artist	22
to get at	22
have been around	22
there is also	22
with the earth	22
wasnt supposed to	22
to join me	22
ahead and play	22
not ready for	22
i dont see	22
but it seems	22
to explain why	22
i met the	22
of what a	22
they do they	22
people who understand	22
were allowed to	22
i had with	22
school and i	22
on a plane	22
than all the	22
first look at	22
it is still	22
as likely to	22
or a few	22
us to build	22
each other so	22
next couple of	22
two hundred years	22
then theres the	22
your eyes and	22
my ability to	22
its a high	22
i was wondering	22
with my colleagues	22
the places that	22
to bring this	22
on earth we	22
most people would	22
so strong that	22
talking to a	22
so i always	22
you have not	22
he talked about	22
i took this	22
the beginning and	22
you about my	22
a little secret	22
not only will	22
a regular basis	22
me ask you	22
believe that our	22
three percent of	22
in a real	22
of the brains	22
not that they	22
city in the	22
the whole planet	22
an animal that	22
and pretty soon	22
everything we do	22
own solar system	22
couple of hours	22
know anything about	22
it much more	22
but the idea	22
the optimism bias	22
i would want	22
light from the	22
possible to do	22
with people that	22
see each other	22
for the development	22
that these two	22
like it or	22
it we need	22
in latin america	22
talking about something	22
its way into	22
when you bring	22
at the national	22
in his book	22
so when it	22
stand in the	22
front of this	22
our own solar	22
million people a	22
are in fact	22
this issue of	22
for two years	22
over a decade	22
what we use	22
i did is	22
a half thousand	22
the king of	22
of the ground	22
so its an	22
looking forward to	22
of it in	22
of it it	22
this looks like	22
more than five	22
can we take	22
way that was	21
long it will	21
last time you	21
consider to be	21
and raised in	21
are going on	21
what i find	21
but when the	21
for the right	21
beyond earth in	21
are very few	21
in east africa	21
basic idea is	21
has never seen	21
to a computer	21
more to do	21
not just talking	21
given you a	21
that much about	21
to play and	21
ive spent the	21
about 25 percent	21
comes in the	21
a bad idea	21
to the center	21
of our traditions	21
tools that we	21
we can answer	21
had in mind	21
its the kind	21
its not fair	21
equal rights amendment	21
activity in the	21
use them to	21
have all been	21
teach girls to	21
there are huge	21
thing in common	21
and so then	21
the next video	21
ones that have	21
we have something	21
which all of	21
from the us	21
people all the	21
in a factory	21
the period of	21
three friends and	21
thats because of	21
the lead in	21
they continue to	21
you to remember	21
in fact they	21
would we have	21
be sure that	21
talk out of	21
the human eye	21
that young people	21
for the blind	21
a good example	21
when you walk	21
up to 30	21
as we grow	21
lets come back	21
room on the	21
in the mail	21
the case for	21
they have this	21
just before the	21
moment that i	21
dont know exactly	21
no no no	21
about what to	21
not only about	21
who are living	21
so all the	21
time but it	21
i want the	21
our girls to	21
with me for	21
we dont take	21
with the money	21
thats not quite	21
theres something in	21
dont like to	21
it for years	21
as a teenager	21
all that i	21
we know them	21
in this talk	21
trying to tell	21
until we can	21
if i do	21
to you this	21
a guest on	21
so you think	21
because ive been	21
something that happens	21
has had a	21
of the skin	21
dont know who	21
where you want	21
playing video games	21
he decided to	21
what type of	21
which is more	21
people are more	21
had no choice	21
talk about them	21
they asked me	21
to have one	21
a very clear	21
he seems to	21
supposed to go	21
and i wont	21
is talking about	21
we got this	21
you feel the	21
the brink of	21
we found in	21
that go into	21
the rest is	21
got a very	21
to be around	21
to life on	21
i was five	21
its able to	21
the deep sea	21
if no one	21
challenge is to	21
scanning electron microscope	21
was very much	21
up at night	21
the duration of	21
next 50 years	21
could create a	21
going to fix	21
of my childhood	21
can take this	21
it and its	21
so it looks	21
matter what the	21
of those planets	21
the kids are	21
so i spent	21
the wake of	21
i know youre	21
from time to	21
you that they	21
the dark matter	21
of the vehicle	21
society in the	21
will give you	21
the orbit of	21
people here are	21
then we had	21
has made a	21
out to all	21
that we as	21
high school movement	21
from the back	21
to make life	21
i made the	21
have been going	21
blown away by	21
i was terrified	21
and we make	21
to other species	21
a very clever	21
to the final	21
weve started to	21
a fundamental way	21
to see these	21
to use that	21
able to come	21
that is really	21
to stop it	21
in the wake	21
the years that	21
add to the	21
came home from	21
it so much	21
order to achieve	21
about on the	21
to solve all	21
picture of me	21
the illusion of	21
and then another	21
and that allows	21
would never have	21
time is different	21
of description where	21
easy to get	21
in a clean	21
your own experience	21
the idea behind	21
to see me	21
see whats happening	21
that i call	21
tend to get	21
to some degree	21
i think some	21
sense of humor	21
we will continue	21
to the country	21
an age where	21
with our partners	21
its too late	21
that are smarter	21
them in their	21
i just say	21
of your work	21
she was also	21
clean energy revolution	21
been part of	21
to some people	21
it should not	21
need to live	21
freedom of speech	21
understand where the	21
the rising africa	21
and heres why	21
five and a	21
wish i had	21
putting people first	21
you wouldnt be	21
compare that to	21
and create a	21
ive learned that	21
that didnt work	21
about how it	21
of a single	21
we learned a	21
to what they	21
good news for	21
people i know	21
better understanding of	21
giving rise to	21
may be able	21
the past 20	21
to hear it	21
a very basic	21
when he came	21
of ourselves and	21
is a solution	21
am i here	21
of our bodies	21
where you go	21
objects that have	21
they go through	21
was very important	21
you are now	21
then of course	21
looks a little	21
never had to	21
it became clear	21
only you can	21
just one problem	21
the perception of	21
you would like	21
percent per annum	21
the country so	21
you to a	21
do it but	21
story is that	21
so we should	21
of money in	21
with my children	21
and not the	21
to build our	21
do we not	21
to perform at	21
help me with	21
may be that	21
they wouldnt have	21
turns out people	21
us about the	21
a tenth of	21
is a particularly	21
far as im	21
of my first	21
show them that	21
a role to	21
what have we	21
of who we	21
these institutions are	21
still have the	21
we go into	21
and things that	21
i give a	21
six or seven	21
each other at	21
time to come	21
not aware of	21
way this works	21
a free and	21
and each time	21
because a lot	21
and they got	21
i also learned	21
a very useful	21
right on top	21
that science is	21
can come from	21
theyre not just	21
when do you	21
which was to	21
activity of the	21
can relate to	21
to achieve that	21
another kind of	21
around the corner	21
to her mother	21
other forms of	21
has to go	21
lot of talk	21
that at all	21
the dangers of	21
later in life	21
found it in	21
of the current	21
this we can	21
much for your	21
and that brings	21
i want people	21
number two is	21
a trip to	21
can put it	21
and you got	21
a sign of	21
but its going	21
second part of	21
but look at	21
way it does	21
wall street journal	21
is a difference	21
growth of the	21
that i see	21
of the stories	21
im asking you	21
of where they	21
also has a	21
the law of	21
has already been	21
any given moment	21
five years to	21
it for our	21
not to worry	21
really have a	21
in a recent	21
deserves to be	21
want to sell	21
are involved in	21
that are used	21
need is an	21
i heard the	21
can play a	21
i do have	21
the director of	21
sister and i	21
i have another	21
the most extreme	21
they could get	21
not seem like	21
that im working	21
of a different	21
to keep a	21
to ask ourselves	21
shift in the	21
for me as	21
bring it to	21
and it actually	21
that would last	21
at this picture	21
you can feel	21
created a new	21
and when my	21
and the us	21
really know that	21
it came in	21
high risk of	21
step in the	21
we can apply	21
it be great	21
would make a	21
dont even notice	21
my work is	21
have a responsibility	21
with you i	21
of a sense	21
that i realized	21
think its going	21
cant say that	21
there are times	21
may be some	21
suddenly realized that	21
think you would	21
was full of	21
the miracle of	21
it works the	21
you one example	21
and how you	21
this piece of	21
red line is	21
to bring these	21
you have on	21
those data points	21
fall of the	21
of tasks that	21
play video games	21
as if he	21
weve been using	21
this should be	21
find out who	21
of so many	21
from all walks	21
ways that you	21
it actually has	21
and now lets	21
because most of	21
we were women	21
desiccation tolerance in	21
out there is	21
one that was	21
i just had	21
regardless of what	21
that is something	21
these new technologies	21
the change in	21
mind that we	21
of that as	21
for the poor	21
higgs field is	21
on a blockchain	21
our responsibilities to	21
you look for	21
the smartest people	21
you can walk	21
for about a	21
so you know	21
far as the	21
the atmosphere and	21
so a couple	21
we cannot see	21
ability to see	21
it becomes more	21
the numbers on	21
give birth to	21
go to your	21
such a short	21
the subject is	21
still going to	21
to san francisco	21
room full of	21
on the ice	21
of the power	21
more about that	21
you could zoom	21
balls in a	21
can bring the	21
in each of	21
but what would	21
theyre working on	21
i get paid	21
when the baby	21
as a sort	21
you two examples	21
do today is	21
of the living	21
as you have	21
is the message	21
i believe is	21
started to get	21
the universe was	21
and down the	21
we did have	21
of these is	21
i could think	21
a huge part	21
is really just	21
here comes the	21
whether we can	21
of technology and	21
they found was	21
and in doing	21
and in every	21
within a year	21
in this kind	21
a very smart	21
interact with their	21
and in so	21
a car accident	21
thing to notice	21
could zoom in	21
because i could	21
care about nature	21
about the waste	21
be forced to	21
we found the	21
to be another	21
side of history	21
you can figure	21
of the economy	21
way you think	21
people are getting	21
of the machine	21
do the best	21
of every day	21
find my way	21
and ill give	21
and im very	21
you can either	21
that because we	21
know where you	21
did you get	21
real and posed	21
had to use	21
to go all	21
in this next	21
we have enough	21
it helps to	21
better than we	21
around the city	21
hours and the	21
get it wrong	21
but the important	21
of these machines	21
come to us	21
changes the way	21
he was looking	21
look at whats	21
its one that	21
ever going to	21
right now that	21
if you consider	21
and right now	21
something with it	21
but because they	21
the sight of	21
something if you	21
when you learn	21
then we built	21
a couple months	21
out of bed	21
ask for help	21
them how to	21
returned to the	21
so we really	21
the freedom of	21
of us had	21
went to work	21
socialized to be	21
passion for the	21
to study this	21
with a group	21
new types of	21
which is untouched	21
i am an	21
we are running	21
a show of	21
these things in	21
who will be	21
of a huge	21
us to remember	21
i study the	21
in many other	21
an era of	21
a reason for	21
in all sorts	21
everything that i	21
a symbol of	21
the prefrontal cortex	21
and when someone	21
have in mind	21
they take the	21
weve never seen	21
you give me	21
theres a huge	21
by changing the	21
going through a	21
when things go	21
ceo of a	21
the data and	21
the peak of	21
you learn to	21
associated with the	21
but ive been	21
they cant do	21
is to figure	21
we just have	21
just last week	21
i can assure	21
why did you	21
the boundaries of	21
good thing to	21
to be alive	21
in countries like	21
even with the	21
in fact is	21
didnt know it	21
for billions of	21
the old brain	21
the part that	21
to which we	21
i said i	21
might like to	21
i could actually	21
wake up to	21
i was crazy	21
together in this	21
tell me which	21
if people are	21
so when they	21
the near future	21
is the word	21
young people from	21
but he didnt	21
different way and	21
i just said	21
that make it	21
its good to	21
kilometers away from	21
and on one	21
to live and	21
risk of being	21
it it is	21
then we started	21
25 years from	21
in a short	21
this story is	21
they sort of	21
jumped on it	21
the cell phone	21
and his father	21
the population and	21
dont you know	21
and together they	21
a reason to	21
would never do	21
but its only	21
in the language	21
completely out of	21
was really exciting	21
theyll talk about	21
from clean energy	21
gross national happiness	21
in the population	21
where i went	21
really important because	21
came to a	21
are among the	21
i found my	21
had done to	21
got a piece	21
no one in	21
front of them	21
on when i	21
nothing in the	21
the right places	21
sometimes you have	21
all four of	21
to be back	21
this was actually	21
that nobody else	21
it consciously seems	21
able to understand	21
that was it	21
they were laughing	21
nature in a	21
i do for	21
thats the sort	21
list of all	21
just as well	21
one thing is	21
dont go to	21
of what its	21
thats like a	21
theory of relativity	21
just a bit	21
to keep our	21
asking you to	21
to share my	21
taken in the	21
us and we	21
and im trying	21
that can happen	21
of the cars	21
the next election	21
the government of	21
of a tree	21
never get enough	21
and understand the	21
the brain has	21
that looked like	21
it can change	21
they ought to	21
the conditions to	21
can have the	21
they dont do	21
the worlds biggest	21
people and about	21
one person in	21
us what we	21
it for granted	21
to los angeles	21
that comes up	21
that i wrote	21
people to take	21
dont know yet	21
i actually want	21
at least three	21
state of being	21
because weve had	21
sounds like the	21
that ive ever	21
most excited about	21
response to drying	21
day to day	21
they control the	21
listen to this	21
where they have	21
i guess i	21
a record of	21
it is only	21
ted talk out	21
the volume of	21
humans that are	21
the force of	21
did the only	21
eight years old	21
wants to go	21
her body and	21
a video camera	21
right now theres	21
life is going	21
man in the	21
level of description	21
we know its	21
give your talk	21
maybe you could	21
it from a	21
maybe i can	21
play it safe	21
turned it into	21
as i think	21
i think my	21
did that happen	21
the market and	21
pictures of the	21
in both cases	21
to a little	21
they see a	21
of a year	21
to the system	21
its an illusion	21
this is possible	21
going to fail	21
coming from a	21
we havent yet	21
before i get	21
the right schools	21
how they do	21
of what weve	21
that has no	21
i felt i	21
going to click	21
it made it	21
everybody knows that	21
how to love	21
the robot to	21
making sure that	21
have the resources	21
by all of	21
half years ago	21
so he was	21
but not least	21
life i had	21
he going to	21
that are living	21
so i began	21
your way to	21
of our country	21
certain kinds of	21
destruction of the	21
are expected to	21
a new project	21
how to go	21
on a different	21
we actually had	21
many different kinds	21
with all kinds	21
the sea floor	21
a story in	21
ive been able	21
people that think	21
id have to	21
eye contact with	21
and i only	21
is an incredible	21
is that those	21
figure out which	21
we cant just	21
us with the	21
the mind in	21
that its possible	21
to represent the	21
is we are	21
with it is	21
terms of efficiency	21
was back in	21
time that they	21
on those things	21
that brings me	21
this was very	21
have to leave	21
starting to see	21
of a long	21
60 cents a	21
very early age	21
our own minds	21
infinite number of	21
copy of the	21
but i could	21
a global citizen	21
to me because	21
so he could	21
you can add	21
going to buy	21
have noticed that	21
know for sure	21
thing i could	21
will make you	21
what are our	21
needless to say	21
as we do	21
matter how many	21
a black box	21
and having the	21
to experiment with	21
have to explain	21
so youve got	21
they told us	21
the genetic information	21
my daughter is	21
that people were	21
thinking that we	21
way to help	21
be very different	21
had to write	21
the numbers of	21
food is the	21
was such a	21
many people think	21
the cloud of	21
the best that	21
of nuclear weapons	21
we are one	21
piece of music	21
about it now	21
how you feel	21
is really interesting	21
then we are	21
and he found	21
free and open	21
of it here	21

i think so	21
two out of	21
and they went	21
san francisco bay	21
i cant even	21
a woman named	21
there were more	21
of an accident	21
been exposed to	21
dont work with	21
that we must	21
of not being	21
there are groups	21
not from a	21
we didnt want	21
all day long	21
there were these	21
you can give	21
allow people to	21
of the english	21
when you feel	21
not interested in	21
the checklisted childhood	21
out the best	21
it means we	21
the words that	21
over time we	21
well it turns	21
world if we	21
and i talked	21
of the animal	21
an infinite number	21
this story about	21
im a writer	21
no longer the	21
its much easier	21
it comes down	21
there are four	21
vast amount of	21
car in the	21
one last thing	21
this is at	21
see where this	21
that wasnt the	21
a lot easier	21
internet of things	21
grew up on	21
have a common	21
of space and	21
made it so	21
ive tried to	21
figure this out	21
what should we	21
out of nowhere	21
my team and	21
and at a	21
the limitations of	21
of the financial	21
show you this	21
where we want	21
it does is	21
the skull and	21
happening right now	21

with a number	21
bear with me	21
they still have	21
was on a	21
the company of	21
cities in the	21
was the key	21
that could have	21
was still a	21
in most cases	21
go over to	21
they use these	21
read in the	21
they said to	21
there was any	21
lot of questions	21
its safe to	21
dont believe it	21
we all agree	21
we let the	21
speak to the	21
in this system	21
the nature that	21
it is because	21
the next 50	21
you can watch	21
lot of attention	21
the national security	21
do that because	21
can no longer	21
this gives us	21
is a single	21
the next century	21
many of my	21
of the genetic	21
amazing thing about	21
is the end	21
the plants are	21
i was never	21
get interested in	21
so i invite	21
try it out	21
understand what was	21
matter where you	21
deal with these	21
how did this	21
potential to be	21
this new world	21
even though theyre	21
then this is	21
i also had	21
i truly believe	21
one thing about	21
touch with my	21
means that theres	21
of miles away	21
existence of consciousness	21
the sex industry	21
face to face	21
actually a lot	21
can assure you	21
to be shared	21
we see these	21
point at the	21
of a cat	21
and do that	21
how to take	21
more than we	21
compare this to	21
the results were	21
five years later	21
together with my	21
in my first	21
and then theyre	21
first thing you	21
the time in	21
people around you	21
is there life	21
come to be	21
the forest floor	21
and women were	21
story that i	21
changed the world	21
show you where	21
trying to put	21
is that maybe	21
and my favorite	21
to fly the	21
to spend more	21
have to address	21
as im concerned	21
when you dont	21
out this is	21
you to have	21
to provide a	21
all to see	21
they would not	21
having sex with	21
to train the	21
mass of the	21
will be at	21
leads to a	21
up to their	21
became part of	21
to find more	21
to have babies	21
our brains have	21
sort of an	21
we dont think	21
and run away	21
the example of	21
to tap into	21
white bark pine	21
a society that	21
a great thing	21
time to time	21
people are living	21
deserve to be	21
the biology of	21
invite all of	21
thing i did	21
they do have	21
more in a	21
live on mars	21
always the same	21
ask questions about	21
on the wrong	21
a drug that	21
so what the	21
thousands of other	21
terms of a	21
can you help	21
doesnt look like	21
for a period	21
from our own	21
a job for	21
on this project	21
on this for	21
but also for	21
evolution of the	21
just to get	21
fundamental aspects of	21
is very much	21
and sometimes even	21
to help it	21
the plant kingdom	21
from a few	21
things on the	21
the performance of	21
year it was	21
need to focus	21
to the conclusion	21
and found a	21
going to speak	21
now the first	21
it we are	21
to me when	21
theres got to	21
you hear that	21
and with these	21
what they dont	21
electricity from clean	21
is enough to	21
button and get	21
child number two	21
on this problem	21
feature of consciousness	21
are all kinds	21
started working on	21
the poor and	21
i can build	21
know its a	21
got to tell	21
a new form	21
that the very	21
know it was	21
people in your	21
of desiccation tolerance	21
in your brains	21
want to read	21
all three of	21
but we all	21
the city in	21
long as they	21
by thinking about	21
can see my	21
what about you	21
that mean that	21
for this kind	21
has been shown	21
waiting to be	21
in between the	21
about 15 years	21
the way a	21
the big question	21
move forward and	21
i will show	21
of the digital	21
changing your perspective	21
so lets go	21
came to realize	21
to be less	21
14 orders of	21
for all to	21
magnitude of the	21
people did not	21
to preserve the	21
which i can	21
down to where	21
waiting for a	21
is a brain	21
of the university	21
who used to	21
look at is	21
what you just	21
no need to	21
that to you	21
like this that	21
i was 15	21
so a lot	21
in a hospital	21
on a stage	21
he was an	21
the mayor of	21
or are you	21
on to them	21
never been more	21
a thing as	21
000 times more	21
it was way	21
willing to work	21
that ought to	21
round and round	21
is just about	21
internet of information	21
of these planets	21
reality is not	21
essentially the same	21
were involved in	21
of the good	21
it was still	21
care about their	21
you do for	21
next step is	21
in the clouds	20
normal and natural	20
two hours in	20
not what they	20
the health and	20
was to get	20
they fit together	20
is for robots	20
so hard for	20
artificial intelligence and	20
makes it so	20
roof of the	20
nearly five million	20
my voice and	20
fact that in	20
and ive come	20
so on so	20
to design the	20
think i can	20
this work and	20
with this new	20
but not only	20
but more than	20
an internet connection	20
in your future	20
of me i	20
died in the	20
and while this	20
that people like	20
make it work	20
no idea if	20
and the blue	20
so much i	20
they were about	20
that much time	20
act you can	20
not as if	20
most therapeutic and	20
gave them a	20
in palo alto	20
we find out	20
serves as a	20
in the states	20
to go over	20
the light from	20
a prime number	20
is just not	20
and everything else	20
how well they	20
well i dont	20
good job of	20
love the most	20
bit more like	20
us and so	20
as i do	20
apply them to	20
i found is	20
to the nearest	20
and ive always	20
but now im	20
think of all	20
is linked to	20
show up in	20
responsibility is to	20
the consequence of	20
the job market	20
stand in front	20
them to make	20
that youve got	20
we understand the	20
and some are	20
about each other	20
gives you an	20
human immune system	20
people who will	20
the country is	20
found in a	20
and these animals	20
i had not	20
went on for	20
you make them	20
have a baby	20
way from the	20
be honest with	20
to google and	20
national and international	20
what happened next	20
forest in the	20
or to the	20
of the sahara	20
drops of oil	20
than the others	20
for a single	20
willing to share	20
tell her she	20
so where are	20
could we do	20
people into the	20
able to continue	20
to explore and	20
they could take	20
on between the	20
came back from	20
do on the	20
it because we	20
about to go	20
the power and	20
but they will	20
the two together	20
playing with the	20
winning algorithms were	20
of the head	20
the last 25	20
of the earths	20
this was one	20
any more than	20
came into the	20
i put my	20
is on a	20
have to create	20
then when you	20
what is known	20
that could happen	20
that i felt	20
by doing this	20
very different way	20
and so those	20
solve all of	20
not a very	20
is an area	20
and it uses	20
you to consider	20
the code of	20
yes or no	20
guy in the	20
from the east	20
when she asks	20
the great thing	20
efficiency or productivity	20
im fascinated by	20
gene drive that	20
high school and	20
the hard way	20
was not only	20
second principle is	20
for you the	20
imagine being able	20
and for all	20
with you it	20
get off the	20
to many of	20
type of technology	20
to me it	20
therapeutic and defiant	20
from the past	20
call this the	20
understand how they	20
know something about	20
you the story	20
shows you the	20
with this video	20
one side and	20
way we have	20
how we make	20
into the pacific	20
interesting thing is	20
put in place	20
why dont i	20
getting rid of	20
almost like a	20
for the planet	20
were being watched	20
he was saying	20
world wide web	20
if youre like	20
used to make	20
the last day	20
its in your	20
find on the	20
is we need	20
what does the	20
a 3d printer	20
so now you	20
theyve been killed	20
used to work	20
power and the	20
will be humans	20
that were just	20
the next four	20
so lets think	20
going to meet	20
but i see	20
might be some	20
than half a	20
to establish trust	20
of problems that	20
looks that way	20
types of thinking	20
when you say	20
and then on	20
what it might	20
me for the	20
it sounds a	20
my brain and	20
she said she	20
killed bin ladenism	20
the animals are	20
bring in the	20
it tells you	20
out the most	20
concerned about the	20
of time that	20
and he took	20
everything else in	20
this second industrial	20
of the lander	20
in the hallway	20
thats really what	20
what i know	20
how and why	20
as early as	20
from all around	20
come with me	20
to expand our	20
have no other	20
to ted and	20
that the system	20
jordan 3 black	20
for the city	20
from the moment	20
can take out	20
put it all	20
to accept that	20
what sort of	20
decide to do	20
be reduced to	20
a human its	20
a lot longer	20
the facts are	20
runs on the	20
to 30 percent	20
symphony of different	20
this artificial power	20
im pretty sure	20
i also believe	20
works of art	20
than 10 years	20
science and the	20
became the first	20
times in the	20
were building a	20
the drugs that	20
the end and	20
that comes to	20
we can choose	20
much smaller than	20
what makes our	20
around for a	20
want to stay	20
along the line	20
a game called	20
a male and	20
about one of	20
al qaeda in	20
they gave me	20
range of acceptable	20
and i realize	20
that came before	20
we found this	20
that were using	20
and i opened	20
that came to	20
in a completely	20
anniversary of the	20
come to mind	20
that you and	20
sense of being	20
to be possible	20
better able to	20
about investing in	20
is full of	20
notice that the	20
bit about what	20
thats out there	20
moved to the	20
we still havent	20
mars and the	20
is smarter than	20
as we heard	20
what is possible	20
so go ahead	20
just the first	20
learn to code	20
this if you	20
the tasks that	20
the shadow people	20
and work with	20
suggests that we	20
to say what	20
and i kind	20
of a billion	20
should be in	20
the work you	20
of the eye	20
think its really	20
that they might	20
gotten out of	20
more interesting than	20
the east coast	20
lead us to	20
walking on the	20
way and i	20
was about 10	20
didnt have that	20
it i mean	20
of efficiency or	20
to a whole	20
that made them	20
to make some	20
to ask myself	20
six months of	20
the emerging markets	20
in the presence	20
could possibly be	20
when you need	20
the question you	20
to where you	20
the deal is	20
the sea and	20
going to know	20
have to realize	20
and now that	20
that write like	20
cities across the	20
learn to do	20
in this sense	20
but it took	20
inside the nest	20
advantage of the	20
spending a lot	20
closer look at	20
that didnt exist	20
just to see	20
would have said	20
they were on	20
this point in	20
and defiant act	20
or even a	20
given by human	20
when i decided	20
and we believe	20
and get to	20
but because we	20
little bit differently	20
it in our	20
and how theyre	20
know that one	20
happened to them	20
so you could	20
plant some shit	20
its no surprise	20
of an apple	20
more i thought	20
he got a	20
the copy behind	20
feel like were	20
try to tell	20
with regard to	20
a certain sense	20
and there will	20
do this all	20
going to feel	20
owe it to	20
them to create	20
let me make	20
you put in	20
on the far	20
you think youre	20
is this thing	20
the world on	20
a study done	20
it would change	20
dont have all	20
make us up	20
like this of	20
way it is	20
the thousands of	20
when they had	20
green and blue	20
it came out	20
more people in	20
told me to	20
am i a	20
to enter the	20
got to say	20
knew that even	20
is a plant	20
our culture is	20
industrial revolution was	20
50 million people	20
number of reasons	20
a technology that	20
we take that	20
say yes to	20
because after all	20
process by which	20
space in the	20
couple of times	20
together with our	20
to launch the	20
know what its	20
each other through	20
now they are	20
its possible that	20
we can push	20
first step in	20
to understand where	20
me for a	20
want to avoid	20
the water that	20
on the global	20
and along the	20
the other forces	20
i will get	20
was the case	20
from high school	20
10 or 15	20
set it to	20
think in terms	20
is the place	20
of the public	20
with the robot	20
have evolved to	20
of religious where	20
blue balls in	20
with these ais	20
about 10 to	20
everywhere i go	20
if you tell	20
matter how you	20
computers for a	20
is that no	20
was the second	20
is the ultimate	20
put it out	20
that are happening	20
the car to	20
would be one	20
my parents and	20
the machine and	20
would have never	20
with a company	20
our ancestors were	20
do it together	20
is very similar	20
me to say	20
we cant imagine	20
the conditions for	20
of the monkey	20
of years in	20
heres what it	20
of work that	20
read about the	20
machine intelligence is	20
ever had a	20
where its used	20
of the cell	20
are embedded in	20
in some parts	20
we have on	20
the process is	20
and we havent	20
of data points	20
youre seeing is	20
the very existence	20
or they can	20
a conversation about	20
that the computer	20
five years time	20
that weve seen	20
i was reading	20
you can experience	20
examples of this	20
us to explore	20
of this data	20
when theyre not	20
to the economy	20
and everything in	20
a human hair	20
and let the	20
harvard business school	20
among the most	20
in the distance	20
one has a	20
wont be any	20
bits of information	20
the choices that	20
people around us	20
give you just	20
it was after	20
purple paper people	20
take a little	20
is there anything	20
results in the	20
one is about	20
he did this	20
think some of	20
cars and trucks	20
huge impact on	20
been there for	20
got there and	20
it as well	20
and even a	20
and that leads	20
million years to	20
of consciousness is	20
they can detect	20
to increase our	20
going to fight	20
then came the	20
needle and syringe	20
pieces of paper	20
the responses in	20
the capability to	20
to read a	20
thats the equivalent	20
my dad was	20
he didnt know	20
universe that we	20
the most therapeutic	20
in his eyes	20
the chance of	20
with the three	20
they dont go	20
one in four	20
of my heroes	20
but just as	20
if we see	20
time if you	20
be involved in	20
everything in between	20
look at you	20
time with my	20
beat the worlds	20
to share the	20
gardening is the	20
as a good	20
power double bind	20
in his own	20
are being watched	20
the focus of	20
of dark matter	20
that were on	20
and the music	20
things that would	20
of this planet	20
for any of	20
show that we	20
very much in	20
second one is	20
can participate in	20
you guys have	20
to go beyond	20
now we do	20
been used by	20
not that great	20
can stand on	20
and believe me	20
he made a	20
of the art	20
i plan to	20
say is that	20
heres a little	20
nervous system of	20
i ask myself	20
to wash their	20
would you ever	20
you decide to	20
trying to save	20
of the interesting	20
but theres one	20
into a room	20
the turn of	20
since world war	20
i take a	20
compare them to	20
can go in	20
a scale of	20
take all the	20
today im going	20
the truth of	20
important for our	20
save a lot	20
is a human	20
make a big	20
as recently as	20
that our world	20
when one of	20
of the speed	20
the tools of	20
try to be	20
same thing and	20
blah blah blah	20
it does something	20
more i feel	20
with new technologies	20
a journey that	20
in our daily	20
the worlds best	20
than a century	20
we think and	20
to get these	20
said i was	20
when you can	20
any sort of	20
maybe theres more	20
have to feel	20
i also know	20
to eat and	20
see every day	20
sense of purpose	20
people would be	20
you can participate	20
global network civilization	20
had been in	20
to the core	20
last 25 years	20
which means the	20
spent the past	20
even when were	20
is having a	20
is strong and	20
they think about	20
need to explain	20
a totally different	20
this time i	20
much more effective	20
to be hard	20
citizens of the	20
out what they	20
what we realized	20
for me that	20
in that it	20
thats what he	20
the theme of	20
does this work	20
for the new	20
thats what happened	20
happened to you	20
heres what the	20
so what have	20
even have to	20
like i did	20
on the highway	20
which you have	20
we sort of	20
to let the	20
right here at	20
defiant act you	20
how we look	20
and sometimes it	20
going to hit	20
get in trouble	20
of having to	20
and more interesting	20
to a common	20
it all on	20
because they can	20
world of warcraft	20
have more than	20
and you all	20
time i had	20
i dream of	20
states and the	20
such a good	20
in a slightly	20
time you are	20
to get around	20
but no one	20
of our human	20
all well and	20
3 black cement	20
i showed this	20
about the rest	20
to be built	20
research shows that	20
or you could	20
i have not	20
do it alone	20
is basically a	20
that was one	20
but i came	20
and after the	20
there were still	20
be humans that	20
encouraged me to	20
found that its	20
theyre not the	20
decided to focus	20
so far away	20
that nature is	20
about the next	20
you can freeze	20
check this out	20
love the way	20
the feeling that	20
we leave the	20
in my body	20
got an email	20
on the next	20
invest in the	20
and then were	20
to it in	20
still trying to	20
to people and	20
want to just	20
million people in	20
we had our	20
the sunshine kid	20
to think what	20
on the tv	20
of the reality	20
think youre a	20
and the experience	20
that weve done	20
if you spend	20
to be found	20
time in human	20
over a period	20
which ones are	20
the palm of	20
you have ever	20
by taking the	20
we made the	20
that artificial power	20
just two years	20
you havent noticed	20
do this on	20
to seek out	20
taken over by	20
a mother and	20
that i mean	20
instead of using	20
of string theory	20
but think about	20
to pass on	20
it you know	20
another source of	20
hour and a	20
four types of	20
this process is	20
gave it to	20
middle east is	20
million kilometers of	20
it will go	20
and the ones	20
built in the	20
of death in	20
to show a	20
it makes them	20
theres a really	20
so every time	20
can work together	20
why did they	20
sense of fairness	20
was called the	20
of what this	20
human beings have	20
that doesnt make	20
was done in	20
of the sudden	20
and as long	20
in health care	20
at the root	20
the burden of	20
you right now	20
it to make	20
to fly it	20
and why i	20
with your eyes	20
to be our	20
of hard work	20
the person i	20
sure that these	20
choose not to	20
you and this	20
you did it	20
but i remember	20
you can know	20
before they can	20
work with a	20
the community that	20
talk in the	20
because of all	20
its a long	20
are really good	20
has been called	20
do it yourself	20
prime minister of	20
they give us	20
i ever had	20
and allow them	20
on in my	20
of natural gas	20
and ask the	20
can learn a	20
so once you	20
the catholic church	20
affected by the	20
if youre interested	20
in contrast to	20
to long beach	20
be ashamed of	20
known for a	20
around the earth	20
they must have	20
if you add	20
wrong with you	20
about what that	20
it works its	20
the shadow of	20
coming out from	20
this sounds like	20
and asked them	20
the first ever	20
to adapt to	20
looking in the	20
thing to know	20
two billion dollars	20
think there was	20
started out with	20
look something like	20
way to bring	20
is something i	20
things start to	20
no one ever	20
can you hear	20
of the dark	20
would be really	20
grandfather was a	20
taken from the	20
and the things	20
which is another	20
people come to	20
a superintelligent ai	20
really important thing	20
youre part of	20
longer than the	20
the following experiment	20
is not at	20
at the stars	20
held their breath	20
and it comes	20
and by and	20
it suggests that	20
to solve it	20
people how to	20
to be called	20
are tons of	20
the body is	20
in the press	20
which is great	20
growth in the	20
trying to take	20
good time to	20
roughly the size	20
at about the	20
show it to	20
you tell us	20
need to remember	20
that it wasnt	20
billion tons of	20
book and i	20
degree to which	20
be a place	20
like to get	20
at the height	20
and it may	20
people to get	20
and have been	20
that tell us	20
and say that	20
that had to	20
just take the	20
in the age	20
today there are	20
its the way	20
the golden rule	20
but i wasnt	20
the past several	20
of the poor	20
do this because	20
are important for	20
that to me	20
did the following	20
its so important	20
thing im going	20
i could use	20
a small space	20
they think of	20
their survival and	20
done the same	20
trip to the	20
going to actually	20
you would want	20
be helping us	20
you to pay	20
whole of the	20
around in a	20
turns out it	20
top of their	20
come together in	20
just because of	20
a third party	20
were expected to	20
impact of the	20
the human immune	20
i look around	20
you think poem	20
country and the	20
up with something	20
be associated with	20
this to you	20
to suffer from	20
see that this	20
this is crazy	20
world and so	20
behind me is	20
effect on the	20
you walk into	20
over time on	20
with what you	20
can measure the	20
to these questions	20
able to move	20
big fan of	20
very thing that	20
it with you	20
go to these	20
not an ai	20
name for it	20
a tipping point	20
and makes us	20
almost nothing about	20
that something is	20
cost of a	20
issues of our	20
at any rate	20
it looks that	20
in the culture	20
put me on	20
a good life	20
we are getting	20
was a girl	20
brady background checks	20
the whole idea	20
from the solar	20
her the truth	20
refer to as	20
a day in	20
stay away from	20
if youve been	20
i worry about	20
to prove it	20
to find new	20
in 50 years	20
of the plant	20
can make this	20
this together and	20
to harm them	20
and we created	20
when we start	20
have a car	20
not the point	20
the cells and	20
about 80 percent	20
is a group	20
one is called	20
him as a	20
at the sky	20
i really do	20
it not only	20
though most of	20
is some of	20
the location of	20
at the highest	20
about that but	20
in a specific	20
in the hippocampus	20
which i did	20
and the earth	20
a very bad	20
so were looking	20
the average person	20
is a perfect	20
it was almost	20
that in our	20
to the original	20
the time is	20
that we made	20
and that made	20
talking about how	20
properties of the	20
at the rate	20
and he looks	20
as of today	20
and the reality	20
of who they	20
more difficult to	20
makes a lot	20
nuclear power plant	20
the forest we	20
problems and the	20
of how technology	20
now i think	20
stop us from	20
of like that	20
of these women	20
and thats true	20
of the arab	20
it the other	20
the black and	20
of the uk	20
believe that if	20
we ask for	20
of a big	20
can actually have	20
the folks who	20
were down to	20
we show it	20
to a world	20
to their children	20
but now i	20
we want a	20
the results are	20
two very different	20
try to help	20
the machine learning	20
we learned about	20
was a study	20
think i see	20
think that was	20
actually has a	20
that was being	20
in your pocket	20
come back from	20
of our world	20
that was when	20
on a grid	20
see how much	20
on the radio	20
was not allowed	20
to the amount	20
i was pretty	20
think of them	20
the difference is	20
it feels good	20
so just like	20
it to do	20
an expert in	20
to the community	20
along with my	20
between those two	20
uncertainty and the	20
out about the	20
so in 2012	20
believe that when	20
but the people	20
were doing here	20
know that he	20
you do a	20
i know where	20
them to come	20

by saying that	20
able to accomplish	20

people to go	20
try to answer	20
and with all	20
of someone who	20
the side and	20
we were working	20
ways to make	20
took all the	20
is a video	20
there and you	20
even though weve	20
now at this	20
could do the	20
we dont care	20
but thats what	20
on what they	20
it i had	20
up a whole	20
the spaces between	20
the world wide	20
in a society	20
that comes in	20
about it it	20
other people that	20
next few decades	20
world around them	20
but i cant	20
to 100 percent	20
test for poetry	20
things were going	20
the arts and	20
algorithms were able	20
its not good	20
studies have shown	20
a company that	20
a good day	20
miles away from	20
looking at here	20
worry about it	20
the project is	20
and it shows	20
back with a	20
had the idea	20
kind of religious	20
in those areas	20
of the arctic	20
i come to	20
best chess champion	20
was working in	20
know that as	20
on mars is	20
were afraid of	20
renewable energy and	20
if you feel	20
two years after	20
is ready to	20
in and the	20
this leads to	20
is a young	20
done in a	20
the dark net	20
better than what	20
and across the	20
front of my	20
at least not	20
if i take	20
today in the	20
one and the	20
couldnt figure out	20
what its about	20
they were given	20
i wont be	20
back to what	20
we realize that	20
advanced potty training	20
do our work	20
none of it	20
the statue of	20
going on the	20
what i need	20
is given to	20
atmosphere of mars	19
sure that people	19
they came to	19
and it became	19
by doing so	19
had to change	19
have an amazing	19
at all its	19
means that there	19
any number of	19
needs of the	19
four of the	19
of information and	19
in their communities	19
was that it	19
a road trip	19
than they do	19
and to look	19
years of evolution	19
planet in the	19
think of our	19
fight against the	19
percent of what	19
the national academy	19
these planets are	19
its amazing to	19
the way for	19
it is their	19
the last several	19
same thing happens	19
meet that demand	19
the screen and	19
scale of the	19
could do anything	19
with a high	19
you could never	19
and those of	19
and i moved	19
all over europe	19
its a simple	19
moving to the	19
the other kids	19
of the audience	19
so some people	19
someone who was	19
we mean by	19
the ways in	19
then im going	19
on a lot	19
and thats us	19
slow it down	19
of color and	19
in ways we	19
we will do	19
to grow into	19
in the hot	19
making its way	19
time and energy	19
you see with	19
and the technology	19
imagine that the	19
or in some	19
be done in	19
both in the	19
each other the	19
also have some	19
the sky and	19
what looks like	19
got involved in	19
the same principle	19
we went down	19
is so great	19
it over and	19
these kids were	19
fight climate change	19
youre one of	19
will see it	19
institutions from the	19
in washington dc	19
few things that	19
story about how	19
just know that	19
to four hours	19
technology and the	19
that at a	19
comes to us	19
but even in	19
is as important	19
true of the	19
the patterns of	19
the formation of	19
the middle kingdom	19
so im very	19
the deep ocean	19
to push the	19
there were people	19
a very particular	19
do we use	19
that even in	19
such that the	19
and my family	19
can count on	19
to talk today	19
that are at	19
with a team	19
i didnt understand	19
was having an	19
going back and	19
these kind of	19
they were a	19
high school i	19
and also we	19
if youre anything	19
just about the	19
acts as a	19
you help me	19
to ask my	19
like all the	19
the ottoman empire	19
to have your	19
looked at what	19
have imagined that	19
over here is	19
so i go	19
because what it	19
love to do	19
that may not	19
we talk to	19
reaching out to	19
only do you	19
north america and	19
they have better	19
of modern art	19
is associated with	19
going to just	19
a love story	19
about three months	19
takes a little	19
at the history	19
tone of the	19
never be the	19
people went to	19
the news every	19
share the same	19
measure of how	19
the network of	19
im often asked	19
that there will	19
for how it	19
is another example	19
you feel about	19
never been to	19
were good at	19
turn to the	19
later this year	19
and this leads	19
our friends and	19
is that one	19
that im sure	19
up and say	19
movements of the	19
than a million	19
first time a	19
patterns in the	19
we make things	19
the system that	19
they were really	19
like the first	19
was really the	19
that lives in	19
told me a	19
in a fundamental	19
on what happens	19
so i turned	19
think they will	19
and the police	19
an expression of	19
i invite all	19
of least resistance	19
have been an	19
stay connected to	19
that youre seeing	19
in different places	19
is something thats	19
the shame of	19
its a place	19
if this were	19
you is this	19
show you next	19
one over here	19
dont listen to	19
if you love	19
the women in	19
put it up	19
down in a	19
of what theyre	19
the global south	19
something other than	19
this allows us	19
up all of	19
that comes out	19
youre anything like	19
that happens is	19
issues that we	19
when we asked	19
state of affairs	19
captured by the	19
that they werent	19
me introduce you	19
were left with	19
which in turn	19
at the door	19
dont get to	19
got together and	19
that the us	19
in world war	19
is necessary for	19
seen as a	19
are not doing	19
thats very important	19
that would allow	19
a magical place	19
and understand how	19
interacting with each	19
have heard that	19
had in the	19
ive had a	19
and he never	19
became interested in	19
going to launch	19
by the first	19
on this question	19
i said earlier	19
will do it	19
technology to do	19
the concern is	19
so what was	19
all the information	19
world is in	19
it wasnt easy	19
totally new way	19
im just saying	19
what do the	19
this happen in	19
environment in which	19
was a group	19
the illusion that	19
very nature of	19
but we see	19
thats the idea	19
inside of these	19
and that could	19
we can play	19
know all the	19
and well be	19
of the five	19
going to release	19
that information is	19
but he had	19
about the difference	19
it just so	19
men who are	19
put out the	19
take it for	19
and under that	19
in iraq and	19
it was discovered	19
so we would	19
over time and	19
me that this	19
moment of truth	19
much for coming	19
you know youre	19
nowhere in the	19
that came from	19
have you seen	19
walk through the	19
we get there	19
many times before	19
funded by the	19
dont think you	19
there and this	19
at the south	19
as a global	19
to the concept	19
the tragedy of	19
that would make	19
many times have	19
to the east	19
is home to	19
is due to	19
they can find	19
over the side	19
no way i	19
and had to	19
asking the wrong	19
and we built	19
by the power	19
that the real	19
to design a	19
the us in	19
go beyond the	19
this is him	19
i stood there	19
have our own	19
all part of	19
and up and	19
and to say	19
to change a	19
they ask me	19
i had seen	19
the field that	19
and why do	19
gave them the	19
going to now	19
of the total	19
what we currently	19
did was i	19
be like if	19
anything like me	19
you to an	19
lot of what	19
to control it	19
will make it	19
its about time	19
this right now	19
and trust me	19
probably one of	19
and take it	19
im glad to	19
can you make	19
of video games	19
all we need	19
getting into the	19
im actually not	19
started talking about	19
technology in the	19
liquid water on	19
can be as	19
what she does	19
he did it	19
be in this	19
to address this	19
and work on	19
in the village	19
two billion people	19
the rules that	19
was fascinated by	19
actually is the	19
to get wet	19
wanted to help	19
for all that	19
them on a	19
of the journey	19
into a box	19
one day be	19
we know theres	19
up here and	19
my goal is	19
like i had	19
found that people	19
you had no	19
inspire us to	19
the capacity of	19
that goes into	19
to learn the	19
doesnt matter how	19
best in the	19
the engine of	19
in any one	19
those individuals who	19
and why are	19
and we learned	19
the press and	19
here in front	19
actually have the	19
about how they	19
spent more time	19
wanted me to	19
have you can	19
in the northern	19
but over time	19
of a piece	19
but the next	19
ive got the	19
on in their	19
that controls the	19
and perhaps in	19
through the process	19
it was true	19
at the risk	19
is more of	19
began in the	19
98 percent of	19
a grocery store	19
in these countries	19
our education system	19
are doing in	19
million of them	19
i could just	19
what could we	19
see what they	19
people and a	19
of that in	19
know and what	19
office of the	19
of quantum mechanics	19
i was shocked	19
were not the	19
was like to	19
and its quite	19
all we can	19
in that situation	19
thats one reason	19
of the traditional	19
born in a	19
you should know	19
if you try	19
smaller than a	19
real question is	19
show me the	19
of the parties	19
how you would	19
and its getting	19
that not all	19
as an individual	19
the whole concept	19
that matter to	19
we cant be	19
be applied to	19
really know how	19
33 years old	19
the first example	19
you notice that	19
all of humanity	19
doing that and	19
a few friends	19
of food is	19
a new set	19
i thought of	19
wrote a story	19
long as i	19
the window and	19
was at that	19
saw this picture	19
do and i	19
in our communities	19
the southern oceans	19
the path to	19
is if we	19
make more money	19
as all the	19
because its only	19
one had ever	19
we will eventually	19
to learn so	19
the way from	19
from that point	19
in the window	19
just a lot	19
when things dont	19
we set out	19
followed by a	19
place where the	19
years later in	19
a game of	19
really long time	19
it got a	19
time trying to	19
lets find out	19
named after the	19
the body that	19
makes for a	19
the composition of	19
was just the	19
its not exactly	19
with somebody else	19
the very top	19
the velocity of	19
for your children	19
i chose to	19
by the government	19
it works is	19
that half of	19
you do in	19
are made by	19
which i was	19
with you the	19
it goes down	19
one of her	19
this meant that	19
just a tiny	19
are risks to	19
to watch a	19
museum of modern	19
an issue for	19
grow in the	19
they use the	19
you can spend	19
we thought about	19
was proud of	19
can not only	19
them to learn	19
the concerns of	19
very few of	19
what i say	19
artist in residence	19
taught me to	19
years ago this	19
need to consume	19
to protect themselves	19
lot to learn	19
thought i would	19
for him to	19
it started to	19
the stories we	19
names of the	19
its in our	19
to remember the	19
and she looked	19
one month old	19
that they did	19
the love of	19
a little better	19
with that is	19
fact that a	19
could do so	19
only when you	19
good at it	19
need to buy	19
university of washington	19
know if youve	19
to the last	19
sooner or later	19
both of us	19
do is you	19
story is this	19
years this is	19
the least we	19
it what it	19
looked at them	19
thought they were	19
a fruit fly	19
important for the	19
we make in	19
over 20 years	19
at all but	19
every bit as	19
i agree with	19
is seen as	19
but its hard	19
to me for	19
of this robot	19
in the climate	19
what i dont	19
to actually do	19
you see them	19
as we say	19
matter to you	19
just the same	19
the most mysterious	19
that what they	19
could tell the	19
from the planet	19
we also had	19
last but not	19
across the planet	19
million times faster	19
and because it	19
grew out of	19
do it well	19
good place to	19
tell you two	19
going to cut	19
any part of	19
really understand it	19
up until the	19
human its not	19
something like the	19
i cant believe	19
it has two	19
time that it	19
we could potentially	19
and they think	19
out to do	19
in the sun	19
how much it	19
because every time	19
has been so	19
leading cause of	19
will allow you	19
day i was	19
size of your	19
opened up a	19
a handle on	19
to bring them	19
no longer just	19
pulled out of	19
this so i	19
them that the	19
symbol of the	19
tell them to	19
looking at one	19
show that the	19
on its way	19
but we had	19
this on the	19
to fix a	19
me at the	19
in some other	19
are going through	19
of the music	19
find it in	19
i couldnt get	19
so ive got	19
side by side	19
into our brains	19
years at a	19
with your kids	19
instead of going	19
and thats it	19
and thats in	19
between humans and	19
you find yourself	19
was 14 years	19
will help us	19
often talk about	19
a dream of	19
in the two	19
us the most	19
when it goes	19
and more recently	19
you to get	19
on the rooftop	19
let them go	19
the economy and	19
you would say	19
to alter the	19
the best possible	19
people would say	19
too this is	19
a solution for	19
about it a	19
of you i	19
been created by	19
the ones you	19
as a designer	19
fed up with	19
this really is	19
on a new	19
around on the	19
been done in	19
we dont work	19
as i started	19
was too late	19
of course that	19
the entire population	19
this is completely	19
when they first	19
so based on	19
to get past	19
like this but	19
with their friends	19
a bad place	19
the present and	19
so how are	19
could be more	19
is that so	19
it and a	19
the day we	19
in this together	19
by more than	19
was very clear	19
think about things	19
down and i	19
in more than	19
and we realized	19
and continue to	19
able to afford	19
first step to	19
three times the	19
is simply the	19
wide range of	19
book in the	19
is that some	19
went through a	19
for three years	19
what was really	19
and i built	19
and the chinese	19
and he seemed	19
and to help	19
that will enable	19
how it looked	19
also learned that	19
my favorite part	19
more than 200	19
doing is making	19
out to have	19
can do for	19
aspect of the	19
to the police	19
that may have	19
could try to	19
telling the truth	19
they have access	19
based on that	19
to turn to	19
live in today	19
out what was	19
also started to	19
when i arrived	19
clear that we	19
a patch of	19
as they could	19
to do right	19
and we discovered	19
who tried to	19
have you heard	19
is known to	19
good this is	19
have developed a	19
invited to the	19
solve these problems	19
the limbic system	19
would be more	19
three out of	19
the digital world	19
a moment in	19
be grateful for	19
work is that	19
and people would	19
in other animals	19
thats a great	19
knew nothing about	19
of making the	19
with what i	19
years of doing	19
the funny thing	19
we have access	19
they didnt think	19
like that i	19
people see that	19
and they know	19
two thirds of	19
had to put	19
i arrived at	19
of life we	19
a moment that	19
surprised to see	19
i would run	19
course this is	19
more than three	19
being on the	19
the government has	19
that we wanted	19
be done with	19
my lab and	19
invited me to	19
be a pretty	19
a book on	19
to stay alive	19
an instrument of	19
way for the	19
to get off	19
have to remove	19
to support the	19
the peace corps	19
holes in the	19
for life in	19
with the basic	19
weve been studying	19
months and months	19
you hear me	19
that a very	19
people to see	19
what comes next	19
amounts of money	19
first thing they	19
live on a	19
to her and	19
thinking of the	19
we traveled to	19
do away with	19
make your own	19
i highly recommend	19
years ago but	19
mars is a	19
we will find	19
a wide range	19
pretty good at	19
who are these	19
a country like	19
just looking for	19
not what it	19
to supply the	19
then i go	19
of my patients	19
the coming years	19
on the people	19
realize that you	19
we run the	19
went out on	19
it is how	19
as a very	19
and take them	19
on a comet	19
dont we just	19
its that the	19
in contact with	19
the demands of	19
today is the	19
of the month	19
but not to	19
ive never been	19
three months later	19
mean that you	19
we could try	19
have a wonderful	19
connect with each	19
using it in	19
under the surface	19
introduce technology to	19
to add a	19
would give us	19
us has a	19
on the sidewalk	19
was told that	19
care so much	19
the ideas that	19
or i can	19
that well be	19
the best place	19
a new technology	19
now the problem	19
end of your	19
enough for me	19
like most of	19
like the world	19
to take these	19
brought to the	19
able to read	19
every part of	19
was doing a	19
a terrible thing	19
where we need	19
done is that	19
got all the	19
the same brain	19
we still dont	19
a camera and	19
time for this	19
learned in the	19
and making a	19
we can keep	19
and theyre like	19
the poorest countries	19
these men and	19
because theyre going	19
to generate the	19
observations of the	19
we see around	19
a study on	19
realized that it	19
i learned in	19
right now i	19
i remember that	19
one to the	19
up over the	19
that we consider	19
years and i	19
want to move	19
in the place	19
blew my mind	19
the machine that	19
to connect to	19
as well it	19
it in an	19
a new behavior	19
believed that the	19
this was something	19
who are very	19
a high risk	19
the survival of	19
mother and father	19
of all humanity	19
to experience the	19
to read this	19
even think of	19
story in the	19
the home of	19
whats in your	19
even more powerful	19
when people are	19
stand on the	19
decide whether to	19
that the secret	19
youre seeing on	19
of a more	19
saying that we	19
as a political	19
to be mindful	19
and based on	19
other things we	19
through the ice	19
can be so	19
is a piece	19
a depth of	19
dont even want	19
i met with	19
then he said	19
to use them	19
there but the	19
who have no	19
check the box	19
question is whether	19
with a small	19
out of her	19
she was talking	19
of a community	19
invest in these	19
just because the	19
and ive never	19
they dont actually	19
to be interested	19
end of life	19
want to point	19
work for us	19
size of that	19
are all important	19
people are in	19
you can write	19
so when a	19
he and i	19
of work in	19
agree with the	19
then i found	19
if we change	19
that are part	19
or one of	19
to us all	19
how to think	19
i spend a	19
coming together to	19
to make ourselves	19
long time i	19
we find the	19
one year later	19
the same event	19
a roomful of	19
most amazing thing	19
universe is not	19
as a team	19
you can come	19
i tend to	19
to find those	19
of a large	19
what i just	19
a whole other	19
could get a	19
that i read	19
going to determine	19
know that thats	19
so its important	19
and what id	19
once a month	19
here and this	19
a half times	19
as high as	19
give you another	19
is making a	19
do have a	19
do it as	19
i and my	19
youre kind of	19
tried to build	19
people wanted to	19
problems with the	19
my body was	19
see it with	19
one set of	19
to turn into	19
ive got some	19
us more than	19
save your life	19
in their pocket	19
what seems to	19
is whats going	19
wider range of	19
told you a	19
when we compare	19
the average american	19
wait to get	19
on each other	19
at a cost	19
quickly realized that	19
was made in	19
living inside of	19
heres another example	19
i ran into	19
cause of autism	19
up off the	19
and the british	19
switch on the	19
what was being	19
makes it a	19
that of our	19
in the evolution	19
make sure its	19
or not the	19
there are tons	19
wouldnt want to	19
like we had	19
had decided to	19
read a book	19
are good for	19
to you what	19
of the impact	19
im most excited	19
not quite sure	19
the same reason	19
percent of your	19
and you learn	19
of the globe	19
got a call	19
you know your	19
me was that	19
you know them	19
you can count	19
these are called	19
them as a	19
would you please	19
to keep going	19
home is the	19
as the great	19
who are working	19
a far more	19
determined by the	19
he found that	19
to touch the	19
of a life	19
now thats a	19
to create more	19
he was there	19
do other things	19
on a few	19
able to start	19
country right now	19
have to imagine	19
because our brains	19
that is exactly	19
to them in	19
think i have	19
can go and	19
in the exact	19
and the two	19
we got some	19
is that now	19
my back and	19
new neurons in	19
we can afford	19
of our food	19
are so much	19
that people do	19
is this going	19
after some time	19
up out of	19
wake of the	19
all the stuff	19
looks like its	19
suit of armor	19
also have the	19
terms of our	19
is there is	19
how are they	19
in one place	19
actually the first	19
theres just not	19
person who has	19
no other way	19
the person in	19
always in the	19
world where everything	19
if i put	19
change is a	19
how could it	19
take all of	19
love and compassion	19
to come home	19
places where the	19
that lots of	19
three of those	19
them up and	19
the significance of	19
and they became	19
also had a	19
time on the	19
that has ever	19
we can watch	19
the government to	19
way for me	19
and the computer	19
back of your	19
the world over	19
walked into the	19
the most extraordinary	19
six months after	19
during the summer	19
under the control	19
really interesting question	19
am i looking	19
whatever you call	19
for being here	19
in the heart	19
that allows me	19
and you feel	19
have an answer	19
for that but	19
talk today about	19
we fix this	19
their own terms	19
and stuff like	19
in and so	19
to it so	19
is the human	19
goes through a	19
its actually been	19
the one to	19
but over the	19
this tells you	19
the continent and	19
decided to try	19
of the above	19
more effective than	19
had to move	19
into the real	19
fact that were	19
go like this	19
all want to	19
they take time	19
as a leader	19
to imagine the	19
decades trying to	19
which there are	19
i am sure	19
just want you	19
because i realized	19
use to make	19
there are now	19
in the boat	19
a spectrum of	19
that was developed	19
a million miles	19
to carry the	19
to explore this	19
actually on the	19
and he used	19
to move and	19
available to the	19
went to my	19
not that much	19
if you keep	19
world around you	19
try to bring	19
because all the	19
path of least	19
will try to	19
the technology that	19
is doing it	19
so they had	19
ones with the	19
the bush administration	19
and together we	19
to know who	19
this i think	19
it to them	19
you wont be	19
them at the	19
be coupled to	19
got to take	19
place in a	19
about their own	19
because they all	19
we were actually	19
we really wanted	19
of mental illness	19
lets try to	19
for two and	19
and they should	19
we could start	19
nothing like a	19
you for a	19
standing on the	19
the daughter of	19
it is what	19
can predict the	19
a lot i	19
would rather be	19
the floor and	19
in a bottle	19
how long will	19
a very exciting	19
living on the	19
around with the	19
when he got	19
where i come	19
it was created	19
be like the	19
focusing on the	19
and the biggest	19
did this happen	19
way we were	19
a week and	19
to tell lies	19
doesnt mean anything	19
least we can	19
to do our	19
and you do	19
the most remote	19
are required for	19
to tackle the	19
very familiar with	19
when the first	19
a drop of	19
got interested in	19
billion people on	19
what has been	19
he did a	19
if we all	19
giving this talk	19
from that perspective	19
of the animals	19
of who i	19
to say its	19
to teach you	19
it was from	19
of like this	19
when there are	19
have been trying	19
to turn around	19
had so much	19
a tiny fraction	19
and the final	19
hidden in the	19
you with me	19
before you go	19
of the drugs	19
which is going	19
actually not a	19
brain this is	19
had all of	19
ourselves feel better	19
thanks to this	19
is simply a	19
just tell me	19
of the benefits	19
able to hold	19
able to impact	19
of the structure	19
wrote a letter	19
looked at my	19
you think thats	19
give rise to	19
then i learned	19
there he is	19
away from me	19
of the red	19
on the horizon	19
its something thats	19
is that by	19
of our problems	19
of these four	19
im sure we	19
we launched the	19
i hear that	19
analysis of the	19
groups that are	19
you sit down	19
so every year	19
it must have	19
its because the	19
look at an	19
wanted to create	19
he said the	19
way it was	19
be better off	19
in that context	19
and were working	19
metric tons of	19
to cross the	19
about a problem	19
the women of	19
have been shown	19
that are already	19
things and so	19
the cancer cells	19
you is going	19
that are still	19
that when they	19
but for all	19
in that particular	19
away in the	19
they believe in	19
a model for	19
on the ted	19
out in front	19
be surprised if	19
trained as a	19
the most fascinating	19
us who live	19
many hundreds of	19
far more important	19
of the window	19
the activity of	19
behind the scenes	19
out to a	19
new forms of	19
with it so	19
prudent path forward	19
and that there	19
have a real	19
and i should	19
has to work	19
of the plane	19
an opportunity for	19
read about it	19
that our brains	19
that people want	19
who are going	19
of art and	19
even more difficult	19
know theyre going	19
we bring the	19
them to get	19
happening in our	19
wasnt until i	19
every time it	19
really focused on	19
in lots of	19
want to study	19
find a new	19
i think many	19
buy a car	19
we dont actually	19
up one day	19
for it its	19
when you write	19
matter very much	19
last one is	19
shown in red	19
to join us	19
that they cant	19
about whats going	19
maybe its the	19
out and say	19
say something about	19
small piece of	18
and going to	18
to be what	18
and im so	18
where it can	18
for six months	18
our society in	18
we started thinking	18
there are eight	18
is found in	18
week or two	18
place at the	18
all along the	18
to worry is	18
about 20 percent	18
off the internet	18
but once we	18
communities in the	18
we would love	18
in the high	18
experiments in the	18
and so heres	18
our transportation system	18
30 or 40	18
fighting each other	18
so thats not	18
it goes to	18
you dont mind	18
way of making	18
more on the	18
of time but	18
from fossil fuels	18
their families and	18
of the surface	18
course of human	18
seen anything like	18
ive been asking	18
only one example	18
may be hard	18
these are really	18
wake up and	18
how you do	18
there was actually	18
you think theyre	18
and she turned	18
likelihood of depression	18
thought i had	18
lives on the	18
the pacific ocean	18
theyre doing and	18
problem that were	18
and its because	18
because they could	18
all this data	18
see a very	18
and using this	18
but to be	18
the visual system	18
about the age	18
sense that they	18
to encourage the	18
from which we	18
coming of christ	18
even notice it	18
should do something	18
research on the	18
at the head	18
you wont find	18
like to play	18
the ice in	18
the ice is	18
in the british	18
take pictures of	18
the intensity of	18
few years back	18
and they start	18
to perform a	18
another group of	18
down the line	18
of the virus	18
learned was that	18
who worked in	18
but it shows	18
our liberal democracies	18
world and this	18
of the place	18
tells a story	18
speak up for	18
it so the	18
bottom of that	18
was a place	18
of the tumor	18
on that point	18
really struck me	18
into a single	18
to hide and	18
the thing you	18
have the will	18
and the guy	18
it was completely	18
is in your	18
the next stage	18
is focused on	18
were in an	18
and i quote	18
the little ones	18
with this technology	18
with a couple	18
able to say	18
but ill tell	18
are two things	18
and the message	18
do so many	18
then they go	18
a thing called	18
idea worth spreading	18
only half the	18
right before the	18
get back in	18
an existential threat	18
in my car	18
you know those	18
noses and mouths	18
have an experience	18
take over the	18
in the ceiling	18
had the first	18
no choice but	18
you can easily	18
thats much more	18
global climate change	18
hundreds of dollars	18
and how that	18
what we thought	18
is that many	18
to absorb the	18
he is a	18
even more interesting	18
them all the	18
there was just	18
and i even	18
it shows you	18
you can turn	18
it and this	18
has the power	18
able to connect	18
data on the	18
what people do	18
clear to me	18
in software and	18
that was going	18
a few words	18
you took a	18
each other about	18
audience member 4	18
people like this	18
then you go	18
that i said	18
the shores of	18
would allow us	18
also a little	18
a tool of	18
what the heck	18
was right about	18
can go into	18
held on when	18
you use it	18
doesnt have an	18
has ever lived	18
the persistence of	18
i read it	18
conversation with a	18
and i suspect	18
right and wrong	18
other countries and	18
you might imagine	18
the stasi was	18
been a great	18
thing as a	18
you take your	18
the chinese government	18
not in my	18
to the side	18
same time and	18
only two photons	18
for this generation	18
that a little	18
so why do	18
of the 15	18
to the pole	18
the right data	18
a way i	18
is what were	18
all manner of	18
that thats what	18
and he actually	18
of the male	18
this stuff so	18
and this isnt	18
of flowering plants	18
solve all our	18
for a kid	18
able to live	18
not knowing who	18
this problem for	18
you a different	18
and there would	18
to play video	18
robots that can	18
not alone in	18
this woman was	18
its the idea	18
on the part	18
of waiting for	18
but now its	18
had just finished	18
to launch a	18
with us on	18
i end up	18
few of my	18
they have these	18
i found the	18
a dream job	18
its full of	18
to have those	18
but its all	18
our eyes and	18
going on at	18
back and forward	18
to be from	18
taught us that	18
of human thought	18
started out as	18
you spend your	18
front of her	18
pieces back together	18
be the global	18
me to get	18
pigs noses and	18
to compensate for	18
forgotten your name	18
in the central	18
youre all doing	18
which is now	18
maybe a few	18
higher rates of	18
this picture was	18
a lot on	18
as the other	18
will come into	18
get a very	18
reduce the risk	18
order to create	18
we worry about	18
see if this	18
which has never	18
to buy her	18
and then of	18
you that there	18
started to feel	18
or not you	18
sounds a little	18
for 10 years	18
this time with	18
question for us	18
may be just	18
tell if im	18
and number two	18
that were there	18
that are required	18
it now we	18
and look out	18
outer surface of	18
they see it	18
the temperature of	18
and it seemed	18
allowed to be	18
lot of food	18
take out a	18
and he made	18
a dinner party	18
a forest in	18
a forest is	18
so why are	18
child number one	18
the us constitution	18
them so i	18
of his head	18
we started working	18
by a computer	18
different sorts of	18
is only a	18
but i love	18
just show you	18
on millions of	18
the day i	18
but we never	18
what we might	18
where is that	18
the original sound	18
from what we	18
exactly how the	18
decided to come	18
outsource our responsibilities	18
a good story	18
thing this is	18
do in my	18
the uncertainty of	18
first time you	18
everybody in the	18
so my dad	18
showing it to	18
that those people	18
into our machines	18
that have a	18
the far future	18
to feed the	18
he doesnt have	18
starting with the	18
are a great	18
is telling the	18
its how you	18
on me nowadays	18
so is better	18
negative impact on	18
a little lamb	18
was really a	18
that happened in	18
to find my	18
when you sit	18
than you do	18
even the best	18
between now and	18
i should tell	18
theyre in the	18
we can easily	18
are using the	18
that you couldnt	18
it taught me	18
their bottom line	18
i may have	18
over a billion	18
of years later	18
billions of neurons	18
space of all	18
the tree of	18
it but we	18
tells you how	18
begin to look	18
it up so	18
only way you	18
thing that the	18
in buenos aires	18
i mentioned earlier	18
to go get	18
the early 2000s	18
to the beach	18
are all different	18
might be wondering	18
detect childrens lies	18
about female friendship	18
a bit difficult	18
im a neuroscientist	18
chk chk chk	18
even more of	18
it still is	18
get a good	18
under one roof	18
never seen anything	18
safest and only	18
be doing and	18
have to spend	18
and we admit	18
now some of	18
than that its	18
very much of	18
work that i	18
well do it	18
in for all	18
a piece that	18
of the amazon	18
with this i	18
the image to	18
is a protein	18
where i grew	18
generation of people	18
and fast and	18
important but difficult	18
parts of our	18
heres a recording	18
be allowed to	18
this is done	18
thats the end	18
which is like	18
of your time	18
know who to	18
by the very	18
in almost every	18
to change my	18
ago in the	18
machine would be	18
in blue on	18
the car seat	18
play a role	18
20th century that	18
you seem to	18
then when i	18
have been there	18
its probably going	18
were still in	18
say thank you	18
that they found	18
think theres something	18
how do the	18
towards the end	18
are you saying	18
explain what that	18
tradition of the	18
that lets you	18
you be shown	18
and he couldnt	18
the hope that	18
ive heard the	18
theyre willing to	18
into the right	18
of a certain	18
so many years	18
the biggest danger	18
his wife and	18
wanted us to	18
because now you	18
start of the	18
a little nervous	18
go with the	18
they started to	18
the answer that	18
what all of	18
suggest that the	18
been doing for	18
lets say that	18
you can pull	18
we cant afford	18
the book and	18
are you with	18
could ever do	18
but then something	18
that they must	18
the music and	18
floating in the	18
sense of community	18
forgotten how to	18
our best to	18
introduction of the	18
i hate to	18
what they would	18
the gravity of	18
queer and trans	18
waste from the	18
understand it and	18
notion of normal	18
from the crowd	18
we wish we	18
out over the	18
building superintelligent ai	18
down all the	18
nature and the	18
that goes on	18
than 30 years	18
the way through	18
every time that	18
talk about your	18
this to me	18
photograph of a	18
come across as	18
was just thinking	18
are basically the	18
youll notice that	18
people who like	18
the right track	18
so as youre	18
a bottle of	18
i do want	18
every time a	18
or maybe just	18
in their life	18
do it at	18
because they think	18
on the video	18
and hope and	18
is a song	18
than the one	18
believe we can	18
got off the	18
with an open	18
that you wouldnt	18
know what your	18
at mach 20	18
years ago at	18
that is when	18
explain a little	18
to help make	18
a very typical	18
like to believe	18
i appreciate that	18
camera on the	18
with a computer	18
picking up on	18
the depths of	18
is that at	18
not only going	18
always been the	18
the cells that	18
mean by that	18
that for me	18
it takes for	18
all those who	18
a reason why	18
black widow and	18
are if you	18
way beyond our	18
something that people	18
personal dna machine	18
it on your	18
reason were told	18
aboard the international	18
the one you	18
am not saying	18
even have the	18
what did it	18
worked at the	18
can remind us	18
go through that	18
you just cant	18
with these two	18
now and i	18
world with a	18
in my hometown	18
of the scientific	18
are taught to	18
of an eye	18
this machine would	18
the crisis of	18
the smartest person	18
made me feel	18
a hell of	18
my daughter and	18
and thats something	18
predict the likelihood	18
something that looks	18
doesnt tell us	18
division of labor	18
they would rather	18
that the answer	18
at what they	18
are stuck in	18
of the stasi	18
the other group	18
a young boy	18
many types of	18
a consequence of	18
but the reality	18
then you are	18
did when i	18
should we live	18
at a number	18
to figure it	18
the past year	18
equivalent to the	18
it all goes	18
words of the	18
appropriate emotional response	18
in the rain	18
system and the	18
and very soon	18
but whats really	18
that at least	18
have the chance	18
in his mind	18
i found i	18
intelligence into our	18
since the end	18
were inspired by	18
that we only	18
to decide what	18
is just trying	18
the contents of	18
human rights and	18
the students and	18
its own right	18
to their peers	18
leave the european	18
our cities and	18
weve all seen	18
you ever forgotten	18
it i have	18
where you would	18
i was interested	18
about the universe	18
millions of tons	18
people who say	18
i got involved	18
brain and what	18
medicines patent pool	18
an immense shock	18
interest in the	18
was only one	18
water to be	18
ability to imagine	18
seems likely that	18
why do some	18
earning as much	18
open up the	18
their communities and	18
world we need	18
they asked them	18
up in our	18
young man who	18
hard and to	18
should all be	18
you take out	18
intelligence is here	18
autonomous robotic weapons	18
is the world	18
so i really	18
half of their	18
actually be a	18
because i can	18
emotional response to	18
an appropriate emotional	18
him to be	18
thats not good	18
to the airport	18
i mean that	18
that means the	18
looks more like	18
live your legend	18
third of our	18
my life was	18
a person that	18
can also look	18
is an opportunity	18
are back to	18
i heard a	18
no reason why	18
were told to	18
or maybe even	18
new better off	18
the women who	18
ways that dont	18
why should you	18
almost the same	18
enough to have	18
but youve got	18
whether its in	18
you have your	18
and while i	18
ago with the	18
wanted to ask	18
thats one thing	18
our intelligent machines	18
the very small	18
right to work	18
i can think	18
you like it	18
this was happening	18
once you know	18
as we fly	18
and the point	18
notice is that	18
in our collective	18
the sensory consequences	18
us intelligence agencies	18
change the cells	18
its in a	18
understand that the	18
the problem we	18
of the jungle	18
ive been living	18
at least six	18
of these and	18
i put this	18
to 40 percent	18
talk about some	18
down and he	18
a new one	18
i am is	18
another part of	18
source of energy	18
spent much of	18
interested in it	18
important to understand	18
the space shuttle	18
it because they	18
chronic traumatic encephalopathy	18
to take an	18
see the water	18
type of agriculture	18
way of a	18
to them that	18
for us but	18
can learn to	18
to write the	18
should look at	18
can he tell	18
of any kind	18
the risk to	18
to create these	18
is that after	18
too much for	18
elsewhere in the	18
but is it	18
of hope and	18
machine learning we	18
you get better	18
take away from	18
so we do	18
the same pattern	18
telling the story	18
you think your	18
we did and	18
once said that	18
get down to	18
the tools and	18
not on the	18
didnt expect to	18
that and the	18
an important part	18
help us to	18
about their lives	18
and you actually	18
i see next	18
in our brain	18
my theorist colleagues	18
the site of	18
can we learn	18
been on this	18
is the wrong	18
guardians of the	18
me all the	18
to see just	18
should i do	18
is the exact	18
your own body	18
30 years later	18
of computer science	18
told not to	18
for decades and	18
of their genetic	18
lets do a	18
we grew up	18
lives and i	18
you to make	18
problems of the	18
even going to	18
50 million years	18
and theyve got	18
the reason you	18
you have something	18
its what the	18
per capita income	18
figuring out what	18
and he got	18
that is your	18
help us make	18
this world that	18
up against the	18
sensory input so	18
is actually an	18
the future it	18
that were seeing	18
groups of people	18
and when people	18
im the first	18
went over to	18
a bad day	18
no other animal	18
they go into	18
they love the	18
to turn the	18
to twitter with	18
biggest danger is	18
the american economy	18
what is an	18
exactly what you	18
behind door number	18
would you be	18
thousands of these	18
other in a	18
but i really	18
we in the	18
struck in the	18
you about one	18
then theres this	18
the luxury of	18
programs that are	18
him to the	18
do it now	18
there wont be	18
have you forgotten	18
the earth that	18
to compete with	18
one or the	18
ive got this	18
and its probably	18
did a lot	18
youre a failure	18
may think that	18
over the surface	18
i go on	18
if the soil	18
flies in the	18
only prudent path	18
in my entire	18
if they didnt	18
get through the	18
what that does	18
thats not so	18
when all the	18
20 years to	18
more information about	18
now that i	18
as a member	18
thing that is	18
the answer lies	18
you know we	18
in the chain	18
like a new	18
of you would	18
thats why you	18
just go and	18
suggests that the	18
she is strong	18
and you take	18
another one of	18
three billion letters	18
cars on the	18
play in this	18
be here today	18
the gay lifestyle	18
a string of	18
that night i	18
they find it	18
they said they	18
your system is	18
we build it	18
is all the	18
hours and then	18
the northern hemisphere	18
been in this	18
the right amount	18
now i was	18
know what was	18
we are losing	18
of every single	18
to look more	18
of information processing	18
none of those	18
but how did	18
average age of	18
time it was	18
did you peek	18
part is that	18
on my laptop	18
going to produce	18
very hard for	18
see that that	18
a gap between	18
in about five	18
it is estimated	18
also wanted to	18
around and i	18
world to see	18
is a major	18
listen to what	18
four billion years	18
in with a	18
going to want	18
a host of	18
these supercharged carbon	18
proud of you	18
the highest levels	18
want to improve	18
point out that	18
has been able	18
theres a good	18
once told me	18
problem its a	18
the man on	18
of value in	18
to be silent	18
cells that are	18
to this is	18
the vastness of	18
but the general	18
000 people in	18
during the course	18
the degree to	18
i couldnt make	18
if im lying	18
said yes to	18
a new place	18
fourth and final	18
john von neumann	18
its way to	18
this its a	18
is an absolute	18
we can improve	18
and forth and	18
i can start	18
you know when	18
to the bone	18
a white picket	18
because of my	18
can understand the	18
york to long	18
more important to	18
and he didnt	18
this that we	18
what we already	18
the garden of	18
have done a	18
was pretty good	18
if you let	18
my office and	18
so i created	18
all they have	18
all the details	18
spinal cord and	18
dont know and	18
in it for	18
on his way	18
from the way	18
time and its	18
to secure our	18
if its just	18
need to worry	18
i didnt do	18
and i study	18
a simple question	18
here to dream	18
all these amazing	18
way we could	18
than you might	18
me up and	18
so much energy	18
people to the	18
and working in	18
is estimated that	18
home this is	18
of the river	18
national academy of	18
thing i can	18
and pretty much	18
also like to	18
do you come	18
made it possible	18
think the most	18
invest in a	18
are about to	18
a lot that	18
theyre really good	18
this one was	18
and the old	18
will build machines	18
you is not	18
ants are using	18
thats very different	18
in the french	18
the first five	18
idea of where	18
the resources that	18
tell if youre	18
but theres also	18
did they have	18
to see him	18
best thing that	18
available right now	18
information on the	18
be the kind	18
of those tasks	18
i want that	18
he gave me	18
spectrum of intelligence	18
i was fascinated	18
having a conversation	18
where it came	18
its only when	18
terms of its	18
of the wealth	18
much more complicated	18
i got there	18
who are doing	18
the same people	18
today we have	18
where we really	18
and in an	18
get the best	18
not what im	18
was not that	18
so the problem	18
whats great about	18
of the situation	18
it doesnt exist	18
that but we	18
them have been	18
and not drill	18
rest of this	18
about the internet	18
risk of depression	18
occur to me	18
of our brains	18
to fear failure	18
that were used	18
to the places	18
a neural network	18
united states for	18
taken off the	18
thats a whole	18
version of a	18
realize that there	18
the average age	18
in mind for	18
this robot to	18
so we took	18
a window of	18
that ive learned	18
perceived to be	18
and only then	18
otherwise would have	18
lets see how	18
at a new	18
moment to consider	18
be capable of	18
minute or two	18
i actually was	18
by natural selection	18
but its just	18
here to show	18
who happened to	18
was doing it	18
almost all the	18
across the us	18
can tap into	18
before your eyes	18
to my mind	18
thing i really	18
him he was	18
now imagine that	18
saying that they	18
and at first	18
for the ride	18
the mystery is	18
the safest and	18
be doing things	18
the first human	18
of the government	18
were told not	18
conditions to do	18
put out a	18
smarter than we	18
because it had	18
and he starts	18
be working on	18
think that that	18
of this building	18
with a fellow	18
it seems likely	18
i know youve	18
i have that	18
inside of us	18
of global trade	18
sure that this	18
of the causes	18
to love each	18
labor is a	18
make us human	18
that people in	18
and only prudent	18
if we know	18
if i choose	18
you how the	18
a process that	18
in what i	18
i was raised	18
with me on	18
to share homes	18
known to be	18
of time thinking	18
that really is	18
a way in	18
started to do	18
and this idea	18
more than this	18
as a social	18
is its not	18
and ill tell	18
three reasons why	18
needed to make	18
theres too many	18
has been around	18
the other three	18
they come in	18
world its a	18
they will not	18
those three things	18
we go about	18
or to have	18
of course it	18
the better off	18
know more than	18
were part of	18
gospel of doubt	18
buy her a	18
eight to 10	18
to actually look	18
rest of our	18
what you call	18
is rooted in	18
and then these	18
by standards you	18
i dont use	18
of the history	18
thats not that	18
you can click	18
upside down and	18
with my colleague	18
out a little	18
the words and	18
in much of	18
on the head	18
that are close	18
to describe it	18
now we dont	18
and so did	18
good to be	18
but it looks	18
of east texas	18
i had learned	18
who was in	18
expansion of the	18
way we are	18
the woman who	18
of people out	18
used to sing	18
anchor computation for	18
a mission to	18
because of these	18
not something we	18
to be religious	18
is it so	18
their genetic information	18
of the hardest	18
and a good	18
experience in the	18
a magnetic field	18
china is a	18
of that so	18
heres what we	18
i wouldnt be	18
out of me	18
the moon is	18
result is that	18
the body to	18
listen to my	18
but you might	18
should we work	18
in partnership with	18
you cannot do	18
when i began	18
from all different	18
sitting in traffic	18
have a kind	18
on something in	18
whether youre a	18
are larger than	18
have to believe	18
have been watching	18
working on for	18
you how i	18
the white picket	18
you help to	18
trust the idea	18
to do before	18
to describe the	18
we havent seen	18
the single greatest	18
try to take	18
doing bad things	18
had all the	18
that the ants	18
thing i know	18
of these little	18
to stop that	18
for one reason	18
i just put	18
in the european	18
are going at	18
im not good	18
way for us	18
illustration of how	18
just because you	18
is a word	18
you thinking about	18
have been living	18
in the 18th	18
should we be	18
full of people	18
to change in	18
is it getting	18
around at the	18
are coming from	18
is happening now	18
also think that	18
on their heads	18
going to exist	18
youve heard of	18
have the technology	18
access to good	18
hear about the	18
to the american	18
i realized it	18
theyre exposed to	18
of the challenges	18
the legs of	18
when i learned	18
the children who	18
but do you	18
create economic growth	18
about is a	18
months after the	18
feel at home	18
how to walk	18
those who do	18
but we say	18
if i look	18
to me with	18
at four oclock	18
i would give	18
and to test	18
numbers of immigrants	18
than we can	18
anyone in the	18
be really important	18
a lot harder	18
a car and	18
this is great	18
the disney store	18
me and say	18
been working for	18
the economy as	18
we have over	18
we decided that	18
and i played	18
all over again	18
looked at a	18
a cohousing community	18
was so excited	18
state of mind	18
to a large	18
he looks at	18
is easy to	18
and whats more	18
death in the	18
can we change	18
to things like	18
us that it	18
and i need	18
you forgotten your	18
going to explain	18
i believe its	18
class of insecticides	18
that i worked	18
so i need	18
on it in	18
is just to	18
we create our	18
thing that really	18
the cayman islands	18
do to get	18
if you find	18
regardless of the	18
hundred years of	18
be really hard	18
to reclaim the	18
a work world	18
places on earth	18
got rid of	18
this was before	18
keep up with	18
find out about	18
to do very	18
back down to	18
but its been	18
late last year	18
said to them	18
concept of introspection	18
he says that	18
from the new	18
because theyve got	18
it was beautiful	18
for two days	18
and we still	18
was that there	18
you see me	18
it is my	18
ive convinced you	18
theres a group	18
talking about here	18
dark matter and	18
respect to the	18
can we get	18
i went in	18
up with is	18
have been thinking	18
going to fall	18
to actually have	18
might end up	18
the ants are	18
the worlds worst	18
refuse to fear	18
of the features	18
a new york	18
here with us	18
even know the	18
all these people	18
the minds that	18
some part of	18
it does in	18
it might sound	18
years and the	18
picked up by	18
if he was	18
you just look	18
the current system	18
that you didnt	18
them together and	18
are millions of	18
fallen in love	18
he could be	18
no one knows	18
trying to answer	18
need policies that	18
and theres one	18
me not to	18
by which we	18
to good nutrition	18
it means more	18
did not do	18
dollars per year	18
we could create	18
this isnt the	18
say no to	18
unable to marshal	18
you are one	18
for them so	18
the basis for	18
a friend and	18
the marine corps	18
you might like	18
by no means	18
which makes it	18
dont believe in	18
not doing anything	18
i wanted my	18
where we found	18
so why should	18
who dont know	18
and were making	18
to their families	18
its not at	18
were also going	18
result is a	18
think that it	18
of time we	18
where does it	18
that seem to	18
they can grow	18
that were facing	18
for a walk	18
of energy and	18
the top left	18
me just give	18
there was always	18
that isnt just	18
my story and	18
but so is	18
see the robot	18
i think our	18
am with my	18
just a second	18
information about how	18
really began to	18
studies show that	18
matter of information	18
that are trying	18
and theres this	18
developed in the	18
going to lose	18
and we take	18
and the life	18
he took a	18
improve our intelligent	18
replaced with a	18
to know more	18
of these technologies	18
says that the	18
say to your	18
lost my sight	18
i disagree with	18
it was kind	18
thing that ive	18
twitter with the	18
on the x	18
adam and eve	18
of our everyday	18
oil is used	18
an ability to	18
go on your	18
what youve done	18
imagine what that	18
how you get	18
whether i was	18
for the us	18
so lets do	18
we would all	18
human resources managers	18
if theres any	18
from the air	18
the stories about	18
this one and	18
this brings us	18
term for a	18
the guy on	18
there and the	18
is very difficult	18
time when we	18
to apply to	18
the movement system	18
reach into a	18
even begin to	18
stood in for	18
neural network that	18
that we used	18
weve done that	18
do we fix	18
asked you to	18
result of this	18
contrary to what	18
doubt about it	18
i just know	18
not looking at	18
actually this is	18
get it out	18
of the founders	18
work and i	18
more people to	18
my little pony	18
the crazy thing	18
all i ever	18
it took about	18
me with this	18
of how i	18
be open to	18
will enable us	18
so fast that	18
nobody wants to	18
not necessarily just	18
but the beauty	18
tell this story	18
we are making	18
of the pack	18
to me the	18
this and then	18
of our cities	18
us are doing	18
made the decision	18
we are but	18
guest on airbnb	18
with the hashtag	18
get the job	18
perception and creativity	18
to be we	18
lets move on	18
an old man	18
the men who	18
a role in	18
change in a	18
and so youre	18
i am that	18
is weve got	18
has the ability	18
to turn up	18
a false memory	18
thats what its	18
during the last	18
a working memory	18
you can ask	18
possible for us	18
the medicines patent	18
we are about	18
that time i	18
expected to be	18
and a great	18
bisexual or transgendered	18
ever forgotten your	18
that we created	18
and yet he	18
enough just to	18
to hold onto	18
we put into	18
to be completely	18
that it looks	18
that was pretty	18
and bring it	18
a gospel of	18
he tell if	18
maybe in the	18
and other things	18
experts think that	18
laptop per child	18
could be something	18
we were wrong	18
along for the	18
work all the	18
do that safely	18
i think well	18
how much this	18
for all kinds	18
to find their	18
exactly how to	18
help us think	18
became one of	18
so we will	18
but then what	18
to a stranger	18
but they did	18
that every one	18
mit media lab	18
that youve seen	18
i saw my	18
in the intervening	18
thats an important	18
likely to use	18
percent of it	18
same type of	18
feel that they	18
so we set	18
could make the	18
because theres no	18
small amounts of	18
the first group	18
there are multiple	18
really excited to	18
like trying to	18
just about to	18
is what he	18
and theres actually	18
no one could	18
weve talked about	18
i promised you	18
us and i	18
surface area of	18
i remember when	18
a press conference	18
the walt disney	18
everything we value	18
i became the	18
if you accept	18
and ill get	18
so the bottom	18
that what were	18
before we can	18
got my first	18
are present in	18
about three or	18
and the young	18
the silicon valley	18
of the disease	18
it does have	18
a little experiment	18
to the social	18
hundreds of them	18
then they come	18
hand if youve	18
but sometimes we	18
architect of global	18
the sides of	18
i looked into	18
of the press	18
and wait for	18
he had left	18
but the good	18
and the size	18
deep blue beat	18
i had found	18
lot of problems	18
effects of the	18
most people in	18
we are expanding	18
bear in mind	18
have hundreds of	18
about what a	18
we share with	18
up through the	18
figure out where	18
it had no	18
an entire human	18
in south korea	18
the connection between	18
the backs of	18
with the fact	18
is whats happening	18
is actually quite	18
is better off	18
i am one	18
as a series	18
nor is it	18
my time is	18
the service of	18
have all kinds	18
explained to me	18
and then as	18
its starting to	18
and then something	18
one laptop per	18
had no money	18
i bought a	18
a couple more	18
youll find that	18
isnt the only	18
if youre lying	18
time one of	18
did we find	18
that are similar	18
and im sorry	18
apart from each	18
we will look	18
my voice in	18
it reminds us	18
i was 12	18
start working on	18
on mars in	18
and the very	18
not just my	18
people in that	18
the web is	18
today is to	18
walt disney company	18
for you is	18
put that into	18
it possible that	18
from the people	18
and got a	18
and in addition	18
really important things	18
ago at the	18
we find in	18
matter what happens	18
as being a	18
the origins of	18
idea how long	18
coming to the	18
was there as	18
mission is to	18
when i became	18
for other things	18
caused by the	18
can take over	18
beginning to understand	18
make it into	18
a huge success	18
im kind of	18
me is the	18
in the minds	17
the detection of	17
your entire life	17
say its a	17
he needs to	17
to where it	17
united states today	17
away and it	17
see it on	17
it took them	17
talk with a	17
main source of	17
everyone to see	17
you dont say	17
get it and	17
know the difference	17
are all about	17
that its got	17
i got some	17
realized that he	17
its used in	17
to end this	17
the other part	17
of the german	17
was caused by	17
person on your	17
colony collapse disorder	17
looks a lot	17
effects of climate	17
whats in the	17
the food that	17
despite all of	17
to help and	17
said to the	17
big data and	17
and they gave	17
be the end	17
the vicinity of	17
that but they	17
or are they	17
place where we	17
to a better	17
go into that	17
we want for	17
to walk around	17
is it something	17
we put together	17
systems like this	17
to justify the	17
youve ever had	17
you a new	17
in my home	17
of the mountain	17
two trillion dollars	17
means that when	17
of light that	17
the most productive	17
they were told	17
of money to	17
must be some	17
get stuck in	17
that i told	17
just looking at	17
were familiar with	17
where a lot	17
to point b	17
project so i	17
we can control	17
and ive seen	17
we bring in	17
half a second	17
creation of a	17
because then you	17
all the worlds	17
to the more	17
it is on	17
and trillions of	17
so it becomes	17
how he was	17
to determine whether	17
the more people	17
at this conference	17
the best ways	17
in your kitchen	17
intelligence here we	17
back to earth	17
it because of	17
the field and	17
to make one	17
into the night	17
in it together	17
too much of	17
and what a	17
a much wider	17
you should never	17
after year after	17
that needed to	17
end of their	17
when we saw	17
my relationship with	17
left is a	17
and the poor	17
he put it	17
a space that	17
you to open	17
that belonged to	17
to a much	17
faced with a	17
able to study	17
different from what	17
at least once	17
was a chance	17
chance of getting	17
had to figure	17
i didnt say	17
one day we	17
he takes a	17
but apart from	17
and the feedback	17
when he wrote	17
give in to	17
thats the main	17
they do in	17
like me could	17
see a new	17
but every time	17
know that your	17
seven days a	17
by a single	17
my guess is	17
out that in	17
code of life	17
talk to her	17
happened with the	17
you go up	17
i can pay	17
in there with	17
know who i	17
through the forest	17
into my office	17
to create some	17
world and that	17
wish we had	17
last of the	17
than trying to	17
the knowledge of	17
be comfortable with	17
you some examples	17
the machine to	17
for us so	17
that people with	17
it doesnt even	17
paid to do	17
an element of	17
millions of other	17
very simple we	17
and i bought	17
the animal world	17
they did this	17
set up to	17
long for the	17
thats a bad	17
the short answer	17
come to know	17
years ago now	17
time to the	17
in the traditional	17
because the pollen	17
that he and	17
was the idea	17
these two ideas	17
and it started	17
you think this	17
day at the	17
the same year	17
the internet we	17
in africa is	17
out to my	17
working in a	17
a little video	17
kind of question	17
that they get	17
in each others	17
you tell them	17
have now is	17
into the body	17
that are made	17
my body and	17
to actually get	17
want to stop	17
looking for them	17
claim is that	17
to ask me	17
then i can	17
and everyone else	17
and that some	17
rise in the	17
being used to	17
of greenhouse gases	17
have a voice	17
as bad as	17
fifty years ago	17
i always say	17
every day of	17
in place to	17
million people who	17
so you need	17
i had some	17
you how it	17
in a desert	17
have a place	17
what weve got	17
the changes in	17
should say that	17
want to listen	17
kinds of other	17
youre more likely	17
we really do	17
thats the part	17
us and when	17
over 100 years	17
about it that	17
exposure to the	17
but the kind	17
of humans in	17
order to accomplish	17
know who their	17
taught me that	17
on the border	17
that have come	17
kind of want	17
how to solve	17
a marine biologist	17
and bring them	17
they have great	17
and why not	17
do this thing	17
of this century	17
everything from the	17
else is doing	17
of your mind	17
there is in	17
goes into a	17
thing that can	17
showed it to	17
real estate in	17
to test those	17
the brain this	17
and of those	17
walk into the	17
lives in a	17
can see there	17
we havent even	17
want to liberate	17
so how did	17
you cant take	17
a wider range	17
why im here	17
can and we	17
no one really	17
attached to a	17
top of your	17
the other guy	17
that meant that	17
i learned was	17
which people can	17
to the data	17
are immune to	17
worked on it	17
look around you	17
or to a	17
is he going	17
and well have	17
us as we	17
and the virtual	17
far as to	17
other thing we	17
and well see	17
stuff that you	17
in right now	17
doing it because	17
second reason is	17
to push it	17
the work i	17
could have had	17
too long to	17
not how we	17
only do we	17
other animals and	17
of whether a	17
the risk for	17
not know this	17
to actually be	17
to 90 percent	17
allowing them to	17
of the police	17
had a profound	17
hours and hours	17
a subset of	17
of the four	17
because in a	17
to see anything	17
that i use	17
this young man	17
of neurons and	17
then its a	17
an audience of	17
and where we	17
weve got some	17
care of the	17
mary had a	17
willing to go	17
the best one	17
crops that are	17
10 years after	17
see here so	17
give them to	17
not such a	17
example from my	17
it is good	17
do it its	17
try and get	17
he told us	17
thats the good	17
she had the	17
im proud to	17
to be president	17
to speak in	17
we can figure	17
gave birth to	17
life out of	17
to the heart	17
it onto my	17
are sitting in	17
whole point of	17
sure that they	17
of these other	17
feel the need	17
has done a	17
to put my	17
of things about	17
about when i	17
to try it	17
are times when	17
in the snow	17
all in a	17
you just heard	17
a great place	17
you told me	17
think the first	17
looks like that	17
man and a	17
be based on	17
going to understand	17
cause of the	17
my way back	17
order not to	17
have thought of	17
would happen to	17
of these services	17
talk about in	17
the one we	17
he began to	17
told us they	17
a day that	17
the right question	17
as i like	17
it to people	17
the technology of	17
to something like	17
even though she	17
attempt to do	17
this notion that	17
massive amounts of	17
there isnt a	17
be something thats	17
quite a long	17
they know who	17
a commitment to	17
you look out	17
come a long	17
you about this	17
to the audience	17
because weve all	17
so if this	17
in a war	17
of it that	17
is by far	17
the lines of	17
to speak at	17
standing up for	17
of the products	17
each one has	17
our country is	17
find it difficult	17
for months and	17
so most of	17
across the atlantic	17
a family of	17
no longer with	17
the picture is	17
i have spent	17
are attracted to	17
very much indeed	17
that thing is	17
to show what	17
story about this	17
now if i	17
able to measure	17
showed up and	17
pretty close to	17
really does is	17
there on that	17
we built up	17
of us together	17
no intention of	17
at all they	17
world has changed	17
we think in	17
we give people	17
for that reason	17
front lines of	17
went up and	17
that im a	17
billion dollars and	17
at it in	17
surrounded by the	17
large parts of	17
its probably the	17
to be incredibly	17
really kind of	17
the decline in	17
i felt this	17
we would find	17
kind of thinking	17
i felt it	17
is all of	17
that will give	17
but you could	17
maybe its time	17
as we call	17
was blown away	17
a child with	17
challenge is not	17
may in fact	17
respond to this	17
been the same	17
a message to	17
we started the	17
have a difficult	17
is not their	17
you would find	17
a room and	17
order to study	17
tell them i	17
me be very	17
and were done	17
job of the	17
took a few	17
happen to know	17
are so difficult	17
is about one	17
tell him that	17
about how do	17
to the war	17
years ago it	17
for the things	17
it be a	17
us that there	17
in this very	17
were seeing it	17
were seeing is	17
will go out	17
i feel it	17
we started this	17
theyre looking at	17
here and then	17
of the national	17
and that doesnt	17
from the car	17
my mind that	17
we at the	17
the companies that	17
is safe and	17
the truth was	17
a room with	17
and because they	17
those things at	17
theres no one	17
ones that can	17
was working with	17
are known to	17
to remember is	17
between men and	17
clean energy and	17
this on a	17
a lifetime of	17
so because of	17
can actually get	17
about math and	17
that im talking	17
any of it	17
because if youre	17
credit card companies	17
i did some	17
make it better	17
of that brain	17
know how i	17
was thought to	17
same size as	17
so i figured	17
six and a	17
this point is	17
even in these	17
when we can	17
were told that	17
single day and	17
show you why	17
it with your	17
you make me	17
because that is	17
step up and	17
on right now	17
think we will	17
want to introduce	17
it was designed	17
than i would	17
even as the	17
the equations of	17
you tend to	17
have to write	17
time so what	17
might think of	17
the mathematics of	17
comes up to	17
the things weve	17
its possible for	17
in the normal	17
the thing to	17
of natural history	17
would that change	17
we made this	17
at a million	17
is because it	17
its a much	17
the small size	17
do so by	17
with their neighbors	17
means that youre	17
is really exciting	17
of our intellectual	17
rely on the	17
when and how	17
look at one	17
could have imagined	17
weve done is	17
to be right	17
other part of	17
the men that	17
be replaced by	17
to bring to	17
are there to	17
turn up the	17
is made by	17
the message of	17
live up to	17
a time and	17
and then more	17
they understand that	17
about these two	17
with our hands	17
it is they	17
that these things	17
i was running	17
is its going	17
up the stairs	17
affair with the	17
need a little	17
can make us	17
they were asking	17
to my mother	17
to another person	17
its a social	17
be just as	17
and we met	17
we built this	17
that so this	17
a chance of	17
when we dont	17
running around with	17
us we are	17
had an idea	17
for two reasons	17
with people like	17
aspects of the	17
do you go	17
i get some	17
theyre coming back	17
going on over	17
to see whether	17
a while ago	17
planets outside of	17
and the big	17
an order of	17
welcome to the	17
we know there	17
to move away	17
we put in	17
a facebook page	17
an email to	17
ourselves in the	17
but what youre	17
in order not	17
is the gay	17
of our minds	17
i started in	17
hit by a	17
in the literature	17
by thousands of	17
it didnt happen	17
giving you a	17
cant make it	17
i only had	17
will not have	17
under a microscope	17
neither of those	17
name of a	17
and because its	17
my heart she	17
i never thought	17
that didnt happen	17
the planet to	17
world it was	17
of them but	17
when they try	17
than we could	17
to make those	17
see that our	17
happens if we	17
the same boat	17
so many others	17
same goes for	17
if we wanted	17
individuals who have	17
are being used	17
need to tell	17
the islamic state	17
than half the	17
though it can	17
to places like	17
time of day	17
came in and	17
we found we	17
in todays world	17
of the scale	17
is taken from	17
is i want	17
much more important	17
than 90 percent	17
and this just	17
a science of	17
the media has	17
all in fact	17
away from a	17
than the ones	17
that allows you	17
all the right	17
other people have	17
people on this	17
it was probably	17
to come down	17
he needed to	17
the globe and	17
in the government	17
saying that this	17
makes you feel	17
you start by	17
lines on the	17
early 20th century	17
was to take	17
percent of my	17
of the group	17
but lets not	17
across the entire	17
theyre not really	17
the mit media	17
the first steps	17
we saw this	17
be here in	17
one another in	17
a political party	17
a very low	17
and if theyre	17
so we all	17
its associated with	17
real time and	17
now there is	17
ive been looking	17
and the interesting	17
in their late	17
to prevent the	17
the problems we	17
all that stuff	17
about creating a	17
my research and	17
you about is	17
now heres the	17
and it showed	17
causes of death	17
have much more	17
before they go	17
even more than	17
to develop our	17
itself in the	17
and i brought	17
at a dinner	17
is to know	17
you spend a	17
on the fly	17
important to realize	17
some problems with	17
go online and	17
but other times	17
when you find	17
sit in a	17
and continues to	17
me to tell	17
is great for	17
economy this is	17
for what it	17
why have we	17
is an illusion	17
page of the	17
they dont understand	17
have a dream	17
so my first	17
and i created	17
on the field	17
of the vote	17
an english speaker	17
the next 40	17
we felt like	17
you agree with	17
in the design	17
thought we were	17
in our life	17
while he was	17
was a wonderful	17
to be solved	17
see that these	17
he must have	17
the planet in	17
as you start	17
so far as	17
on the slide	17
as the sun	17
to kick the	17
it because its	17
things we did	17
im sort of	17
what they told	17
i get the	17
possible and this	17
in the orchard	17
at a couple	17
a little story	17
things on earth	17
when she got	17
more time playing	17
learning is that	17
the world im	17
in the crowd	17
the bones of	17
it opens up	17
probably heard of	17
of the areas	17
together to create	17
us thats the	17
not to take	17
can see if	17
for that to	17
were sitting in	17
males and females	17
be determined by	17
the last 15	17
work to be	17
i was giving	17
is pretty much	17
is it just	17
love and respect	17
was telling you	17
new class of	17
the inside out	17
the most magnificent	17
them with our	17
based on these	17
of us dont	17
of them came	17
talk a lot	17
see it coming	17
do anything we	17
a mindset that	17
thats all i	17
and you make	17
would be impossible	17
and turn on	17
flower to flower	17
i had become	17
the data on	17
but ive got	17
as you think	17
get at the	17
and that gives	17
the leaders of	17
was that when	17
of our conscious	17
why i believe	17
there as well	17
i was blown	17
called the blockchain	17
she came to	17
for breast cancer	17
i cant wait	17
have been making	17
tenth of a	17
our lives we	17
had the privilege	17
thats completely wrong	17
we are always	17
we killed every	17
he would be	17
did was to	17
could ever be	17
out a lot	17
and make an	17
on my website	17
not an accident	17
i feel very	17
days of the	17
i got was	17
do and how	17
to add to	17
i cant imagine	17
over three billion	17
and you also	17
in a positive	17
million people are	17
sounds a lot	17
are not good	17
but its kind	17
for the good	17
guy on the	17
to be thinking	17
didnt believe that	17
we move forward	17
so when one	17
and if any	17
we make that	17
the panama canal	17
and when were	17
as an artist	17
are designed to	17
so lets just	17
i open my	17
longer have to	17
i didnt realize	17
it is essential	17
really interesting to	17
so now its	17
we were still	17
to ask them	17
line in the	17
we do at	17
data and data	17
of the amazing	17
that was our	17
of the street	17
effect on me	17
because i did	17
made me want	17
people and to	17
use this to	17
care of them	17
about how many	17
dont just mean	17
of the buildings	17
exact same thing	17
we would call	17
that was about	17
about the science	17
that give us	17
the extent of	17
of the companies	17
about the second	17
society in which	17
to go ahead	17
not even close	17
participate in this	17
coming back from	17
you to feel	17
im doing it	17
if the answer	17
theyre higher in	17
destined to be	17
was a teenager	17
is on fire	17
from inside the	17
it wants to	17
this needs to	17
these two guys	17
i was already	17
hours of video	17
for people like	17
so even in	17
a grain of	17
be solved by	17
three of us	17
the scientific community	17
because theyre just	17
will lead us	17
this point and	17
go from a	17
you will notice	17
four years of	17
to take off	17
come to your	17
them are going	17
we need in	17
and therefore it	17
structure in the	17
youll have to	17
couple of other	17
as many different	17
of these cases	17
to the earth	17
are a bunch	17
in this brain	17
also think about	17
the rules are	17
small robots and	17
idea was that	17
that even when	17
as we continue	17
something that goes	17
that i used	17
so much fun	17
that has an	17
and others have	17
i had given	17
here are two	17
ready to take	17
ive worked in	17
take away your	17
similar to a	17
there are at	17
would mean that	17
them if we	17
a movie and	17
more about it	17
they have very	17
in the relationship	17
a day or	17
is not on	17
the connections between	17
choice but to	17
first time and	17
to answer questions	17
you here today	17
knew that if	17
was set up	17
weve heard about	17
to find something	17
for its own	17
home to the	17
probably not the	17
great thing about	17
of interest to	17
it anywhere in	17
would go on	17
a king in	17
can be taught	17
take away the	17
tools we have	17
and its pretty	17
have liquid water	17
that theres nothing	17
want to draw	17
than the people	17
the nsa and	17
think so i	17
will begin to	17
is also known	17
know what those	17
knew this was	17
and my answer	17
killed every single	17
it is but	17
me that we	17
if he had	17
on things that	17
moved to a	17
we were driving	17
of the known	17
people seem to	17
take the lead	17
they are trying	17
it for me	17
i mean it	17
what we wanted	17
an invasive species	17
will work in	17
have found a	17
responds to the	17
to ask yourself	17
does this happen	17
and we feel	17
as possible to	17
all the pieces	17
it there was	17
the key idea	17
on a special	17
is it because	17
it uses the	17
world we have	17
they are actually	17
a website that	17
i started out	17
to be enough	17
you can stand	17
lines of code	17
them we were	17
of the classroom	17
does a lot	17
that might sound	17
mind that i	17
then we got	17
as the world	17
to get closer	17
dont actually believe	17
and the state	17
the construction of	17
to actually make	17
at a much	17
how big the	17
took to the	17
if it had	17
make a mistake	17
just has to	17
in our lifetime	17
so when he	17
of my hand	17
from point a	17
the stuff thats	17
need to realize	17
me and a	17
i got from	17
yin and yang	17
to invite you	17
how it might	17
teaches them to	17
an issue that	17
worry about our	17
the energy that	17
maybe all of	17
life would be	17
didnt know any	17
them in your	17
way to be	17
was critical to	17
you ever want	17
nice things about	17
hard to believe	17
all the little	17
work and they	17
go with it	17
of bad news	17
that theres this	17
to benefit from	17
where you live	17
can connect with	17
you will probably	17
whole idea of	17
me before i	17
to start doing	17
right to the	17
i could hear	17
the last hundred	17
to bear witness	17
given to the	17
was because of	17
there it was	17
is that your	17
seemed to have	17
better and so	17
even care about	17
was with a	17
day i went	17
assume that the	17
the user interface	17
an easy one	17
but what really	17
is being used	17
any of them	17
examples of the	17
hours per day	17
you could call	17
this and the	17
looking at how	17
im sure you	17
length of the	17
remember when we	17
to disrupt the	17
day and the	17
i am more	17
that but its	17
was all about	17
track of the	17
today at the	17
you find the	17
up to all	17
out the other	17
same time so	17
that reality is	17
miss out on	17
and those were	17
in a non	17
youre lucky enough	17
been the most	17
on here is	17
also interested in	17
this is sort	17
of them can	17
a different lens	17
i couldnt help	17
we let them	17
to rise to	17
that can tell	17
just like i	17
to me this	17
and theres some	17
people live in	17
not about the	17
knew you could	17
she is the	17
we might want	17
answer comes from	17
a pile of	17
in your home	17
to see who	17
when so many	17
ability to be	17
the big fish	17
you to say	17
at the molecular	17
matter of hours	17
not from the	17
because weve been	17
cant be answered	17
point a to	17
engage in that	17
think thats what	17
their own way	17
was very young	17
this network of	17
at what we	17
is easier to	17
to counter the	17
i remember this	17
and they call	17
and then youre	17
are billions of	17
this world and	17
to make better	17
where things are	17
and gave them	17
and it needs	17
of ourselves as	17
if we make	17
now these are	17
of the tools	17
feel like they	17
that moment and	17
some places in	17
written in the	17
go out to	17
we have as	17
to repair the	17
earth in the	17
to be with	17
sounds like this	17
player in the	17
thats where this	17
the eye of	17
think about your	17
in this project	17
all the kids	17
find out whether	17
in the ancient	17
do this work	17
well in the	17
move at all	17
about this problem	17
united states but	17
as often as	17
never do this	17
very much so	17
are coming together	17
and it allows	17
and within a	17
not have access	17
to reinvent the	17
it just doesnt	17
people have said	17
i am with	17
about that we	17
the solution is	17
cars off the	17
i see that	17
doing now is	17
their own individual	17
within the next	17
bring out the	17
inside of them	17
flipped on its	17
quite different from	17
there i think	17
so this kind	17
my mother and	17
to the many	17
is the current	17
they can take	17
billionth of a	17
funny thing is	17
20 million people	17
now if youre	17
i knew she	17
is this very	17
parts per million	17
get something like	17
believe that these	17
and his colleagues	17
do we call	17
from the previous	17
in which every	17
to our lives	17
the other ones	17
and when im	17
journey into the	17
this led to	17
she has been	17
and have to	17
let me know	17
than a few	17
last one and	17
we called the	17
you one thing	17
the left hand	17
many things to	17
and open internet	17
the question was	17
but theyve also	17
the data in	17
i like it	17
cant melt down	17
starting to make	17
been interested in	17
the very end	17
want to speak	17
years of research	17
happened over the	17
future of food	17
would never be	17
a great time	17
two of my	17
started working with	17
to decide between	17
theyre still in	17
in that red	17
i know of	17
you put these	17
on at the	17
any other country	17
didnt know the	17
of this information	17
its in this	17
to be launched	17
a new body	17
you what happened	17
live in one	17
in what they	17
have to let	17
back to her	17
i would think	17
that would take	17
question that we	17
its got the	17
at the large	17
do it one	17
are not very	17
could be wrong	17
if you play	17
so that by	17
and they werent	17
and you should	17
compares to their	17
say her name	17
me for what	17
out and i	17
last week i	17
have a unique	17
the motor neurons	17
by that time	17
do you ever	17
system of the	17
was doing this	17
this year is	17
can pick up	17
part of its	17
for something to	17
in a high	17
whole new world	17
thats the thing	17
dont think they	17
im not here	17
can take those	17
put yourself in	17
do all these	17
will find that	17
10 years later	17
cracks in the	17
actually see the	17
up and play	17
her face and	17
we discovered a	17
just because they	17
now we get	17
diameter of a	17
not even in	17
students of color	17
our brains do	17
and above all	17
can still see	17
we see ourselves	17
you can begin	17
order to find	17
bad news for	17
as a model	17
to understand something	17
the entire city	17
it the way	17
a child and	17
start from a	17
it a place	17
45 percent of	17
about why we	17
like having a	17
taken care of	17
like me and	17
you had this	17
computer and i	17
are some things	17
and also in	17
museum of natural	17
made a very	17
a very real	17
but this one	17
coral reefs are	17
thought that it	17
is the middle	17
a needle in	17
they come back	17
and billions of	17
you can always	17
good way to	17
is that possible	17
of new technologies	17
you all the	17
she was very	17
but even though	17
us its a	17
much about it	17
food for the	17
and every year	17
think you see	17
not only have	17
available on the	17
the most effective	17
much easier to	17
get an answer	17
what it wants	17
the same goes	17
plenty of time	17
its called a	17
than i can	17
in the small	17
part of creating	17
like to use	17
see what is	17
we used a	17
not how it	17
money out of	17
are in it	17
of the information	17
each others faces	17
what that tells	17
is really powerful	17
us a sense	17
have to protect	17
play around with	17
out how we	17
they cant be	17
turned upside down	17
we started our	17
away from our	17
that the safest	17
to wait until	17
planets out there	17
dealing with a	17
of the ted	17
that theyre all	17
if i cant	17
it happened to	17
you remember when	17
the depth of	17
meters in diameter	17
of what ive	17
anybody in the	17
on to get	17
thats about the	17
early in my	17
was enough to	17
to the development	17
going from the	17
the movements of	17
people and they	17
issue in the	17
based on my	17
the ones we	17
year or so	17
in the kitchen	17
of me on	17
and lets just	17
only way that	17
had to leave	17
you or i	17
difference between these	17
of them you	17
had with the	17
this group of	17
being turned into	17
possibility of a	17
we really can	17
them to give	17
youre doing something	17
to introduce the	17
a car with	17
decided it was	17
they become a	17
see this one	17
back and ask	17
own way to	17
but i still	17
are some people	17
we will keep	17
the blue line	17
of our team	17
have a few	17
but in all	17
extra dimensions of	17
im not just	17
what that meant	17
different ways of	17
to hundreds of	17
early days of	17
now lets look	17
the resources to	17
figures out what	17
who say that	17
can really help	17
is a sort	17
on that fact	17
of what people	17
was a student	17
it and as	17
has had the	17
left of the	17
but theres this	17
to the kids	17
of want to	17
a mouse that	17
work with children	17
almost half of	17
my job and	17
to someone else	17
important as the	17
that are about	17
for our own	17
kinds of stories	17
but to do	17
think that as	17
so its actually	17
need to rethink	17
was a single	17
thing it does	17
simple things like	17
actually have to	17
the universe that	17
probably heard about	17
time and place	17
appear to be	17
other ways to	17
have not done	17
is in some	17
about the most	17
or anything like	17
is difficult to	17
opened up the	17
and comes out	17
im in a	17
a very common	17
have gone to	17
to connect the	17
incredible amount of	17
if you care	17
some people can	17
in a bit	17
things the first	17
it is clear	17
uncomfortable with the	17
where they came	17
there are few	17
is very interesting	17
and they tell	17
of the issues	17
job is not	17
by an algorithm	17
there are going	17
and i finally	17
that change the	17
we feel like	17
chain of being	17
only four percent	17
the war and	17
frames per second	17
as i walked	17
garden of eden	17
do with human	17
our data and	17
these questions about	17
with the human	17
is just another	17
would think that	17
become more productive	17
a second and	17
percent of that	17
literally thousands of	17
making progress in	17
and im happy	17
the police in	17
i started making	17
global warming and	17
an entirely different	17
you hear a	17
who are able	17
around other stars	17
light of the	17
has been very	17
looking at their	17
why i dont	17
seen a lot	17
like everyone else	17
while im standing	17
clear that the	17
building block of	17
a conversation and	17
have yet to	17
have a family	17
and in europe	17
of the leaders	17
world today is	17
the moment you	17
i wrote this	17
them down in	17
is machine learning	17
in as a	17
a digital world	17
in a family	17
from flower to	17
information that they	17
protect themselves from	17
that is and	17
more to come	17
help us solve	17
so how is	17
inspired me to	17
pieces of the	17
exist in the	17
did i want	17
people are using	17
and later on	17
i were in	17
any type of	17
the ocean in	17
months ago and	17
thing that has	17
they can see	17
times larger than	17
him for a	17
world trade organization	17
see this in	17
huge part of	17
which means i	17
all our problems	17
who has been	17
we were the	17
we feel about	17
excited about it	17
time he was	17
a school that	17
should you care	17
to produce this	17
material is going	17
recognize human faces	17
you really think	17
we cant really	17
knew i could	17
could you have	17
to hold it	17
first people to	17
to get those	17
things have changed	17
this question of	17
from people who	17
us not to	17
is called an	17
because were in	17
the day and	17
study done in	17
and so one	17
and thats going	17
to take me	17
to take my	17
put it this	17
we just did	17
would you mind	17
future we can	17
that would happen	17
it hard to	17
we have another	17
is all very	17
first one to	17
the local government	17
if instead of	17
and at least	17
a very beautiful	17
and theres lots	17
you might get	17
look like and	17
brain deals with	17
in the canopy	17
the hebrew university	17
the evidence for	17
the same species	17
better than they	17
and a friend	17
if it could	17
and they actually	17
to really get	17
i pay my	17
doing is trying	17
to bring us	17
to bring up	17
intelligence is a	17
of the relationship	17
is very likely	17
plan for the	17
means that it	17
tell you its	17
very likely to	17
that youve been	17
and ive had	17
so to me	17
but he never	17
that were actually	17
were getting to	17
to the baby	17
we now can	17
enough energy to	17
with this in	17
the living room	17
the higher the	17
is essential for	17
life and so	17
is to help	17
amazing to see	17
immune system and	17
there are plenty	17
one reason is	17
and hope that	17
of the deep	17
the earths atmosphere	17
i went over	17
they do a	17
for good and	17
we had about	17
running in the	17
we told them	17
the measure of	17
matter where i	17
a computer to	17
of world war	17
the brain deals	17
able to access	17
we know today	17
first was that	17
feel that the	17
a to point	17
and to create	17
in a million	17
to be friends	17
it just has	17
movement of the	17
keep us safe	17
and send it	17
working together to	17
build the first	17
connected with the	17
mind that the	17
the internet in	17
show you today	17
and show you	17
way that he	17
apply the same	17
i watched the	17
did not happen	17
an al qaeda	17
theres also a	17
know where its	17
that humans have	17
us government has	17
got in the	17
just a minute	17
i encourage you	17
us a very	17
and help them	17
there are others	17
which i am	17
they were still	17
life of a	17
was actually the	17
kind of data	17
thing for me	17
whats happening now	17
the local community	17
on my back	17
not to make	17
that it comes	17
you play the	17
it achieve the	16
i actually dont	16
be far more	16
on what you	16
of magnetic field	16
in a series	16
make us more	16
all the rules	16
use this as	16
to use an	16
you still need	16
so happens that	16
lot more of	16
the world how	16
shown you so	16
the reason the	16
language of the	16
right now for	16
care of their	16
saving the world	16
who told me	16
alter the human	16
as hard as	16
is running a	16
get used to	16
do with you	16
of our generation	16
is a natural	16
does it predict	16
this doesnt make	16
allowed to do	16
and faster and	16
ill make a	16
decade or so	16
over the planet	16
with the kids	16
again and it	16
as closely as	16
to say goodbye	16
up again and	16
of everything that	16
much time to	16
you only need	16
is broadly applicable	16
its actually very	16
bring them back	16
the worlds leading	16
power and that	16
five years of	16
if youve heard	16
you guys know	16
ahead and grab	16
been a variety	16
about how blockchains	16
tell the truth	16
for a short	16
in all my	16
had seen the	16
my father would	16
system so that	16
so good at	16
that what im	16
to keep making	16
and services and	16
be like that	16
in tribal times	16
brain activity and	16
on the future	16
youll see is	16
i was studying	16
for intelligence that	16
of the puzzle	16
it doesnt look	16
do this so	16
assumption is that	16
we are keeping	16
to take place	16
things from the	16
something that can	16
been on a	16
an era where	16
not only an	16
to compare the	16
and it all	16
one it is	16
youre an alien	16
to use in	16
already begun to	16
if youre feeling	16
that you must	16
there was some	16
when we want	16
to one person	16
world that are	16
not because we	16
ive learned about	16
one is an	16
whatever it was	16
and i turned	16
over again and	16
to see so	16
the first chordates	16
dining room table	16
knowledge that we	16
the swine flu	16
if youd like	16
started my own	16
about 15 percent	16
like the most	16
thats a question	16
is my lab	16
between 2000 and	16
world in terms	16
in a day	16
since the 1950s	16
our society and	16
do those things	16
theyre much more	16
imagine how much	16
give me your	16
made for the	16
they could just	16
a sauce tomato	16
of us on	16
each other they	16
be done to	16
left out of	16
know where i	16
can tell that	16
my job in	16
sent me to	16
but this has	16
opportunity to make	16
to do we	16
able to provide	16
will be no	16
dont actually know	16
when i finally	16
did all the	16
you got the	16
ethical to enhance	16
to something else	16
do the opposite	16
in fact its	16
in for a	16
as there are	16
maybe the ultimate	16
it can actually	16
telling me about	16
here and now	16
id never seen	16
be a kind	16
something in me	16
force for good	16
been trained on	16
who have the	16
than a year	16
our last quick	16
seeing the world	16
go down and	16
lot of water	16
plant profile and	16
and every other	16
to fight this	16
be more mindful	16
weve grown all	16
project is that	16
moved out of	16
of the molecules	16
idea i want	16
is to learn	16
right way to	16
it might seem	16
the americans are	16
somebodys going to	16
97 percent of	16
the dreams of	16
this the first	16
i ask the	16
out that it	16
we did find	16
to know this	16
of the host	16
different than what	16
way it works	16
are a net	16
the impact that	16
ability to control	16
of somebody else	16
it makes us	16
figured out a	16
about the human	16
when he gets	16
often face is	16
in in the	16
we were here	16
order to have	16
that our minds	16
asked for a	16
artificial machines that	16
it causes a	16
this special hardware	16
could have ever	16
how important it	16
and they looked	16
to be entrepreneurs	16
the bhutan for	16
ever seen before	16
didnt begin to	16
anyone who is	16
just as some	16
us in our	16
is much bigger	16
of technology is	16
and if this	16
noticed that a	16
he said it	16
this very interesting	16
decided that they	16
controlled by a	16
far as you	16
years ive been	16
actually end up	16
put all of	16
the money to	16
really good for	16
that was created	16
did not come	16
the world than	16
audience member 2	16
changed the chemistry	16
which is our	16
is under forest	16
so much is	16
of this room	16
doesnt make a	16
that they may	16
such as we	16
was a simple	16
the responsibility of	16
a lot but	16
will be used	16
higgs boson is	16
yusor and razan	16
build a new	16
mother and a	16
have a pretty	16
an affair with	16
a single equation	16
if they do	16
me as i	16
are happening in	16
to it but	16
that he wanted	16
100 years of	16
happen i mean	16
of us like	16
in august of	16
has kind of	16
if youre the	16
it can fly	16
the sharing economy	16
a definition of	16
i loved it	16
that if the	16
of a box	16
where we were	16
thats why theyre	16
the office and	16
you find out	16
actually had to	16
that ive seen	16
they should have	16
of the ideas	16
choose to do	16
in a company	16
some people get	16
a large scale	16
people like to	16

theres no other	16
what if my	16
we did what	16
it thank you	16
it could do	16
all the ways	16
the second coming	16
on it so	16
and this might	16
a work in	16
theres no time	16
to the west	16
and three days	16
to redefine our	16
to do just	16
not meant to	16
back to where	16
many robots you	16
emerges directly from	16
of the gay	16
knowing who were	16
black men ski	16
these different threads	16
as a mother	16
they go down	16
because what i	16
on the train	16
and who is	16
can we tell	16
this object you	16
through a dozen	16
we have failed	16
attacked by a	16
not know that	16
and my mom	16
more than 70	16
you you can	16
is whats called	16
you show up	16
into the community	16
pretty clear that	16
planets that we	16
of girls and	16
being produced by	16
i could i	16
is a fundamental	16
we dont quite	16
you might wonder	16
stronger than the	16
the american people	16
this person is	16
that brought us	16
that level of	16
means that theyre	16
free from the	16
for the procrastinator	16
broadly applicable to	16
i feel a	16
those in the	16
would really like	16
the reliability of	16
sound a little	16
models of individual	16
human thoughts and	16
has a sense	16
together in order	16
was born with	16
youre not talking	16
our way of	16
friend us back	16
put myself in	16
work and we	16
in that environment	16
i can stand	16
it mean to	16
important to the	16
do more work	16
with so much	16
and who will	16
a suit of	16
i was here	16
to everyone else	16
been living in	16
like most people	16
tell the farmer	16
about my country	16
look around and	16
easy to understand	16
building blocks to	16
rest of his	16
it all started	16
times more than	16
evolve human beings	16
also think its	16
know so much	16
in the interest	16
its no wonder	16
the earth to	16
ability to seek	16
slow down and	16
about 20 minutes	16
that in many	16
the geography of	16
told me i	16
is different from	16
trying to see	16
and take the	16
as a threat	16
started to realize	16
can actually change	16
and the great	16
an interesting thing	16
why this might	16
in an environment	16
the naked eye	16
in the basement	16
thought in my	16
could do with	16
is the basis	16
we have added	16
with lower inertia	16
over hundreds of	16
in which that	16
that these robots	16
of our community	16
more with less	16
that is all	16
blockchain technology is	16
is a strange	16
my lab in	16
way and that	16
of our universe	16
in ancient athens	16
do it too	16
seek asylum in	16
is right now	16
in the grass	16
to move that	16
we make sure	16
a simple answer	16
and begin to	16
term memory and	16
phone call from	16
of those countries	16
two black holes	16
not one more	16
and that your	16
world it is	16
soon as he	16
it here in	16
that the cost	16
actually help us	16
false memory that	16
the whole country	16
throughout our country	16
lot of effort	16
i guess what	16
you so far	16
life two civilization	16
of working in	16
place that we	16
tries to maximize	16
and he gave	16
associated with a	16
a little higher	16
keep options open	16
now im a	16
the first intifada	16
somehow managed to	16
their time and	16
institutions like banks	16
in our hands	16
three meters per	16
in that time	16
sound like the	16
for example this	16
country on earth	16
money will be	16
human economic activity	16
and a bit	16
were using the	16
now we want	16
realize that it	16
of it this	16
fountain of youth	16
we have taken	16
can i have	16
leaf area index	16
other when theyre	16
a system to	16
make plants that	16
the main screen	16
to you for	16
year and the	16
looking up at	16
are thinking about	16
how many robots	16
combination of all	16
by a very	16
the bretton woods	16
been asking myself	16
of this network	16
capacity of the	16
the ultimate prosthetic	16
lots of data	16
material produced by	16
life and that	16
which is my	16
we do here	16
wrong with that	16
because it takes	16
the fight against	16
the equal rights	16
if the procrastinators	16
this going to	16
about this guy	16
to ask and	16
the knowledge that	16
he turned to	16
were born in	16
what are some	16
continue to do	16
im standing in	16
got to start	16
to one side	16
have is a	16
on from here	16
what the answer	16
made a decision	16
third and final	16
interested in these	16
had to travel	16
and this particular	16
panama papers that	16
record the voices	16
of paper that	16
you attempt to	16
is that part	16
still see the	16
what im asking	16
grown all kinds	16
use them as	16
to seriously consider	16
of the natural	16
you learn a	16
said than done	16
sharing economy is	16
time of year	16
we want this	16
they want you	16
a fear that	16
new digital recipe	16
with a quote	16
using the word	16
turns out they	16
began to understand	16
put pressure on	16
after months of	16
showed you before	16
of justice and	16
i could leave	16
the previous 10	16
needed to treat	16
and to use	16
what was so	16
us what the	16
on that day	16
from a long	16
also one of	16
of you guys	16
now i get	16
and that had	16
you are on	16
a film called	16
get to this	16
them a little	16
that the same	16
really like to	16
to put your	16
somebody want to	16
but that the	16
us on a	16
truth of the	16
the future i	16
and end up	16
between rich and	16
you make plants	16
you are to	16
use machines that	16
the brain works	16
in light of	16
its really the	16
it to 100	16
the same skeleton	16
of the equation	16
for longer than	16
a serious problem	16
they do and	16
because its an	16
we are providing	16
taught me about	16
no surprise that	16
do to help	16
the threat of	16
a million dollars	16
the ocean that	16
the world all	16
our own galaxy	16
talking to each	16
know what theyre	16
economies in the	16
got to a	16
we have three	16

i was eight	16
published in the	16
economy is small	16
13 years ago	16
lot of energy	16
they see this	16
of the orchard	16
is a force	16
people of ted	16
decided to study	16
the most elastic	16
problem we have	16
of who owns	16
things and the	16
years from the	16
and the political	16
where most of	16
responsible for making	16
a beach in	16
some evidence that	16
all in one	16
there were the	16
live on the	16
lots of little	16
food data centers	16
10 or 20	16
in the trees	16
are not necessarily	16
you accept that	16
was coming out	16
that people had	16
a little uncomfortable	16
to let them	16
putting it in	16
it shouldnt be	16
we have you	16
happen if you	16
who is this	16
of individual plants	16
in america and	16
in this book	16
are familiar with	16
see there are	16
we go on	16
the end result	16
because it can	16
or i would	16
based on an	16
of a team	16
we paint animals	16
internal combustion engine	16
we exchange value	16
these services dont	16
really understand how	16
big problem with	16
face of this	16
the amazon river	16
at the hospital	16
to know something	16
you work in	16
their brains are	16
to map the	16
new brain cells	16
now what we	16
right end of	16
about what were	16
give talks to	16
kids will be	16
possible in the	16
spend our time	16
know now that	16
that theres an	16
its got no	16
they would put	16
is of a	16
you compare it	16
are in my	16
you already know	16
love is not	16
and saw that	16
so we at	16
carbon neutral for	16
is there are	16
in the aftermath	16
part of us	16
and together with	16
the working poor	16
in this one	16
heard about this	16
something very interesting	16
werent able to	16
to finish the	16
to emphasize that	16
feeling a little	16
major league baseball	16
replaced them with	16
in your time	16
heres what you	16
is because weve	16
wikipedia its a	16
of doing the	16
its a nice	16
with deep learning	16
i wanted it	16
object you see	16
can see those	16
also on the	16
out that i	16
how in the	16
so imagine a	16
thinking to myself	16
happened in my	16
and a young	16
are shown in	16
like we have	16
you imagine if	16
in my mouth	16
of pieces of	16
narrative of the	16
here weve got	16
that computers can	16
axis of the	16
will talk about	16
people that were	16
up purple paper	16
can see now	16
is a form	16
the sound that	16
works in a	16
is it ethical	16
uncertainty that we	16
i have three	16
doing with the	16
has lots of	16
the oldest objects	16
this one i	16
not just any	16
is what im	16
a family with	16
to save a	16
to reflect on	16
before you get	16
more people are	16
when were stressed	16
an apple in	16
as you could	16
i was happy	16
use as a	16
we need them	16
get involved in	16
in the previous	16
we can solve	16
my face and	16
us we can	16
be a problem	16
and then suddenly	16
a book in	16
showing you a	16
programmable money and	16
proud to say	16
got it right	16
miss my pre	16
we need some	16
a stone or	16
youre playing against	16
underlying mechanism for	16
made of sugar	16
the evidence of	16
time and see	16
which has the	16
lot of women	16
up and start	16
i did when	16
i was aware	16
19 percent of	16
they get integrated	16
immune to all	16
the issue is	16
dont trust me	16
will make the	16
im a big	16
from this sort	16
to evolve human	16
it is as	16
000 people a	16
a look back	16
and we look	16
space shuttle challenger	16
or a coin	16
billie jean king	16
remind you that	16
these three things	16
in part with	16
them we dont	16
watch the earth	16
of computers and	16
so the red	16
in them now	16
of our friends	16
here theres a	16
longer than i	16
extension of the	16
because theres an	16
here and the	16
with the problem	16
find that a	16
another possibility is	16
can we go	16
to the diversity	16
invited them to	16
humans have been	16
has a long	16
you could go	16
of our people	16
would get to	16
i got here	16
that the future	16
in the technology	16
have come up	16
because we havent	16
looks at me	16
i cant get	16
or does somebody	16
parents and teachers	16
put all the	16
a database of	16
that takes a	16
we still find	16
in place of	16
my own house	16
think is the	16
i had was	16
leave the country	16
or 20 years	16
be really good	16
together and create	16
us to communicate	16
numbers of people	16
the instant gratification	16
technological institution that	16
whole world and	16
the wheel and	16
created by the	16
from this talk	16
context of the	16
looks the same	16
time in this	16
so small that	16
so the more	16
kind of procrastination	16
they love us	16
the fourth thing	16
systems that are	16
if the robot	16
of you can	16
how i can	16
has decided to	16
drop it on	16
for making type	16
in the philippines	16
so you just	16
estimated that by	16
of gun violence	16
is a bird	16
out the hard	16
sent it to	16
a life in	16
make perfect sense	16
for a good	16
the future when	16
i feel so	16
that goes to	16
it can get	16
in a special	16
theyre dealing with	16
a job and	16
that we almost	16
so i told	16
we might think	16
and they thought	16
when he saw	16
theyre hard to	16
in these areas	16
a friday night	16
living there for	16
democracy on us	16
the political spectrum	16
brain called the	16
a view of	16
that process we	16
and its right	16
to not just	16
to raise the	16
i had it	16
that humans can	16
can be seen	16
sense of responsibility	16
is a term	16
for anyone to	16
when you open	16
dont get it	16
the little girl	16
because right now	16
the car seats	16
you stand up	16
and he started	16
billion hours a	16
very clear that	16
may just be	16
but not really	16
im playing around	16
were in this	16
live in this	16
i was supposed	16
and you heard	16
would be nice	16
and women in	16
i was faced	16
an organization that	16
books in the	16
he was all	16
a life two	16
because we cant	16
the biggest ones	16
doesnt matter so	16
and then theyve	16
lot easier to	16
your brains and	16
years have been	16
of the landscape	16
let you know	16
the business model	16
want to evolve	16
to boost your	16
focus on what	16
see if the	16
cell in the	16
at the problem	16
that led me	16
are not being	16
be familiar with	16
of some kind	16
stuck in a	16
a great job	16
say that you	16
they make a	16
to make about	16
it is easier	16
but whats interesting	16
i make the	16
was with the	16
a chess game	16
deep in the	16
just one word	16
of time you	16
i did and	16
a gopro through	16
to the year	16
see the whole	16
experience for the	16
did i just	16
are a carbon	16
the natural machine	16
who gets to	16
we made an	16
sequences of instructions	16
something we have	16
expand our range	16
to share and	16
had so many	16
is hes been	16
by two degrees	16
so youre looking	16
that is happening	16
the back and	16
they ended up	16
im also going	16
we see our	16
at just the	16
every day but	16
production of long	16
it easier to	16
talking to them	16
will change the	16
done for the	16
has gone through	16
included provisions in	16
from the north	16
because he said	16
because its going	16
when does it	16
because you will	16
just based on	16
child is born	16
the law to	16
kind of empathy	16
from the spaces	16
do we turn	16
career as a	16
aware of it	16
very same time	16
the education system	16
of my early	16
the pages of	16
problem in a	16
this will happen	16
whats important to	16
in the blue	16
soon after i	16
profound impact on	16
with a whole	16
we have shown	16
something going on	16
do is just	16
see on this	16
insight is that	16
to the dark	16
in life is	16
protect our parks	16
our own personal	16
on the air	16
with me in	16
the first line	16
a country with	16
done this before	16
the royal society	16
in positions of	16
to people about	16
and on that	16
as to whether	16
touch to see	16
into the ground	16
minds in the	16
the patterns that	16
the app store	16
youre having a	16
you a question	16
to see on	16
advocate for others	16
the transfers that	16
ways of being	16
and that comes	16
that what you	16
so long ago	16
will have an	16
into the field	16
that so i	16
did this is	16
does not exist	16
about people who	16
emotions to other	16
and these guys	16
other side and	16
diversity of possible	16
every day for	16
of genes that	16
the animal is	16
if we ever	16
gave a talk	16
is there something	16
in a robot	16
dependent on the	16
to learn something	16
up with and	16
much as any	16
after the war	16
around the site	16
trillion dollars of	16
trillion dollars on	16
i looked like	16
from being the	16
the same database	16
if your companions	16
i get my	16
day as a	16
of the poorest	16
so we looked	16
realize that they	16
is built on	16
that change about	16
moving on swiftly	16
a job at	16
a mirror that	16
what youre trying	16
life will be	16
of meaning and	16
evolve the human	16
across the room	16
that this will	16
and by that	16
be a leader	16
none of our	16
was a car	16
are even more	16
quite difficult to	16
the time your	16
my country our	16
they say in	16
which are very	16
so important to	16
and the data	16
on with the	16
to be your	16
girls about periods	16
deck of cards	16
things and that	16
know that much	16
to dream together	16
and as im	16
and i called	16
tell you today	16
but the main	16
mechanism for intelligence	16
down to three	16
and the uk	16
where he is	16
of new neurons	16
perform at a	16
of things these	16
we have created	16
is what its	16
the product is	16
way we see	16
to the power	16
easier said than	16
was a sense	16
a vision of	16
entering a new	16
the stage and	16
climate change or	16
jobs that are	16
things that really	16
that the new	16
the future in	16
here is this	16
of it until	16
not only a	16
there are five	16
the plant has	16
is the open	16
the global jihad	16
with their children	16
is a public	16
ones who care	16
this line of	16
and the woman	16
the odds of	16
at a conference	16
from the great	16
that much of	16
im hoping that	16
theres just a	16
that we like	16
are what we	16
that im just	16
i wasnt supposed	16
carbon neutral country	16
this data is	16
and youre all	16
first couple of	16
some way to	16
about 15 minutes	16
up into a	16
gives me a	16
like the strawberries	16
where it all	16
about this system	16
duty of care	16
the tools we	16
about to face	16
everybody would like	16
electricity comes from	16
and its estimated	16
you a video	16
people who love	16
was time to	16
for human beings	16
the canopy size	16
were also really	16
im also a	16
and after all	16
the left brain	16
than we ever	16
your phone and	16
looks a bit	16
always dreamt of	16
but to make	16
i do the	16
in two weeks	16
use it every	16
of a character	16
going on that	16
that will happen	16
able to recognize	16
about this picture	16
and were constantly	16
middle of it	16
you also see	16
as i saw	16
to use digital	16
whole population of	16
that everyone in	16
use these tools	16
of them wont	16
the principles that	16
how long did	16
is that my	16
my dad said	16
places where we	16
about this stuff	16
i know many	16
and sometimes i	16
it be to	16
how have you	16
looked into the	16
the strawberries from	16
the speed and	16
to do business	16
thats the whole	16
i get out	16
i figured i	16
wants to do	16
to help to	16
to understand their	16
you change it	16
you remember that	16
model of a	16
choose to read	16
best part of	16
100 years later	16
by what i	16
square meters of	16
which leads to	16
us to start	16
you can share	16
and we create	16
also a great	16
of this curve	16
will be well	16
when he died	16
little bit on	16
on the morning	16
of the cat	16
this happens to	16
there are really	16
just from the	16
you add the	16
do to you	16
of this conversation	16
what they see	16
way that this	16
descendants to help	16
neutral for all	16
to think in	16
not what you	16
like they were	16
net carbon sink	16
lot of mistakes	16
think is going	16
neuron subsystem suggests	16
of this issue	16
a little closer	16
are those who	16
you can travel	16
can see these	16
im here for	16
any other kind	16
to move from	16
people who worked	16
extend our bodies	16
data and then	16
cant have a	16
our uncertainties about	16
general theory of	16
more natural machine	16
took a picture	16
institutions we have	16
been known for	16
is a privilege	16
and artist in	16
the time scale	16
second of all	16
they could have	16
so the answer	16
looked in the	16
is probably going	16
we can produce	16
and think of	16
but the first	16
that is worth	16
any given time	16
i am convinced	16
this robot uses	16
to anyone who	16
we see them	16
looks very different	16
it was impossible	16
a decentralized database	16
kind of guy	16

wanted it to	16
i was learning	16
which i had	16
just this year	16
surround yourself with	16

a poem that	16
years old when	16

surrounded by this	16
what you will	16
but what happened	16
we can feed	16
if thats true	16

that can cause	16
such a powerful	16

of big data	16
we dont paint	16
can you take	16
do we celebrate	16
theyre out there	16
for much of	16
and not for	16
but they may	16
so they took	16
of things with	16
are the building	16
in our heads	16
important it is	16
a story and	16
i dont do	16
feels like it	16
perhaps there are	16
with a video	16
got all these	16
well as a	16
live in cities	16
who would be	16
sound like this	16
and worked with	16
be a farmer	16
the last week	16
social media data	16
in and day	16
of money and	16
i had someone	16
came across this	16
havent had a	16
cryptographic proof that	16
both sides of	16

now why is	16
side of my	16
in their body	16
to seek goals	16
ever so slightly	16
how to see	16
in our ability	16
all have to	16
the country was	16
but you will	16

really just the	16
go to college	16
whos on the	16
girls who code	16
things in our	16

was not very	16
has pointed out	16
and not one	16
less than the	16
thing that comes	16
ending up with	16
want to alter	16
going to watch	16
last year that	16
its just going	16
came in the	16
in our schools	16
to solve some	16
the surface area	16
is it was	16
and i work	16
she did it	16
i brought my	16
as time goes	16
it is you	16
is a common	16
understand what they	16
something really interesting	16
of the victims	16
now it turns	16
was funded by	16
they know her	16
see how well	16
and share the	16
turn out that	16
just a number	16
never met before	16
a different set	16
the most influential	16
the american population	16
done with the	16
its harder to	16
to this idea	16
of a brain	16
look and feel	16
they were born	16
us have the	16
it was funny	16
work hard to	16
make a choice	16
we often face	16
point on the	16
when a man	16
when there were	16
the world or	16
entire human genome	16
of love that	16
a car is	16
for the environment	16
for that i	16
of myself as	16
lets try it	16
it a try	16
the military and	16
it to another	16
came out and	16
that are growing	16
the belly of	16
and you had	16
up over time	16
a week or	16
of the smallest	16
it if youre	16
that we spend	16
understand what im	16
cryptocurrencies are the	16
about 10 times	16
picked up the	16
us and its	16
for our health	16
been with us	16
me if you	16
to do any	16
a turning point	16
on the cutting	16
of our uncertainties	16
the varroa mite	16
positive emotions like	16
this definition of	16
will come back	16
you will and	16
sense that we	16
wont have a	16
wrong with the	16
missing 33 percent	16
had ever seen	16
on this one	16
help me out	16
from being a	16
think that those	16
is defined as	16
we really are	16
change it in	16
top five regrets	16
are keeping our	16
in a given	16
all this knowledge	16
of the images	16
and that goes	16
a lot so	16
standing in front	16
can very easily	16
doesnt do it	16
controlled by the	16
do every single	16
a virtual reality	16
say to those	16
decided by the	16
we want it	16
body to find	16
study we did	16
of different threads	16
brain in a	16
was the time	16
in harmony with	16
i never really	16
of violence in	16
you now have	16
the west and	16
and everything that	16
every single wolf	16
years to come	16
and yet i	16
and day out	16
does it achieve	16
because it wasnt	16
think of ourselves	16
through a process	16
is only time	16
i get this	16
one group of	16
for these people	16
to be born	16
with the body	16
tell you when	16
have absolutely no	16
use all of	16
a really hard	16
to hire people	16
should use machines	16
have done is	16
it means for	16
we should start	16
ive always had	16
make a small	16
the supply of	16
believe it was	16
them not to	16
to follow the	16
one million people	16
you imagine that	16
im convinced that	16
let me see	16
who owns what	16
the microbial community	16
young men in	16
south of the	16
told me about	16
with the second	16
and im like	16
and run it	16
theres another way	16
we dont get	16
the second experiment	16
and before we	16
type i collagen	16
the earth becomes	16
because that was	16
you should take	16
of time for	16
to drop out	16
be good for	16
is that not	16
you get into	16
walk around the	16
think these are	16
has two hearts	16
should we care	16
bar on the	16
late at night	16
so lets have	16
of people wanted	16
old at the	16
and why this	16
we met with	16
do anything you	16
in other cases	16
is made out	16
theres always going	16
and probably a	16
of living in	16
and theyre very	16
man who is	16
better world for	16
decentralized database that	16
i think whats	16
gives me hope	16
for me but	16
is that life	16
what are those	16
make room for	16
things we really	16
theres so many	16
the skin and	16
travel through the	16
it thats the	16
to be conscious	16
which may be	16
health of our	16
animals that are	16
my students to	16
a failure to	16
one or more	16
of it was	16
were really excited	16
we used the	16
passing in front	16
which is true	16
i call that	16
our very glasses	16
what i like	16
thinking of that	16
signed up for	16
realized it was	16
not a people	16
youll see a	16
past 15 years	16
of the transactions	16
its because we	16
uncomfortable to talk	16
you could find	16
so they do	16
a difference of	16
just be the	16
to them the	16
youre a little	16
do that anymore	16
and most important	16
women have been	16
and human rights	16
than five percent	16
really important for	16
in dealing with	16
ask for a	16
to reach into	16
to walk up	16
top of everything	16
in the trunk	16
a year on	16
with your body	16
a huge difference	16
so much information	16
you understand that	16
this room is	16
nanobio building blocks	16
and in other	16
the guggenheim museum	16
people are looking	16
a year that	16
see this robot	16
and you try	16
many years now	16
the western amazon	16
weve shown that	16
not all the	16
of the ones	16
we should treat	16
forces you to	16
that would look	16
for the 21st	16
won the nobel	16
do they love	16
information in the	16
look up to	16
so ive talked	16
the outsides of	16
kind of just	16
the only difference	16
have actually been	16
that is able	16
civilization is a	16
able to develop	16
think that youre	16
of our nations	16
to you to	16
that many boxes	16
more sense to	16
open up to	16
deal is closed	16
wants us to	16
as she was	16
have a virus	16
much larger than	16
wherever they want	16
sure everybody would	16
became a very	16
in the natural	16
you worry about	16
and make decisions	16
tells us a	16
in my eyes	16
or you have	16
theres one more	16
our children to	16
look for them	16
that means you	16
it says that	16
the way she	16
in public life	16
us make better	16
and he wanted	16
take a second	16
im sure everybody	16
the procrastinators system	16
needed to do	16
to fix this	16
can be no	16
early on in	16
do everything we	16
what if they	16
so i knew	16
its okay to	16
robots that are	16
very small number	16
nothing to worry	16
gdp per capita	16
understand the importance	16
at some level	16
was so much	16
adults in the	16
act as a	16
as it might	16
where we had	16
for the moment	16
we must keep	16
a molecular biologist	16
through the world	16
thank you to	16
their role in	16
the technology and	16
to the car	16
the new mouse	16
really like about	16
and took a	16
up with these	16
and drive it	16
can imagine what	16
when it does	16
is in his	16
it was important	16
people across the	16
a man on	16
can produce a	16
people go to	16
weve begun to	16
and the entire	16
thing but if	16
i needed a	16
me and you	16
that one is	16
have with the	16
refugee camp in	16
to bring about	16
try to convince	16
to a school	16
able to run	16
is all you	16
things with the	16
something that makes	16
on a map	16
how many jobs	16
weve changed the	16
to the machine	16
came from and	16
you possibly can	16
our entire country	16
me but i	16
was really quite	16
little bit with	16
comfortable with this	16
and i held	16
not so good	16
that im wearing	16
in large numbers	16
economy in the	16
at the north	16
into the other	16
a very expensive	16
issue of the	16
for other people	16
and make sense	16
the air force	16
babies are going	16
in the journal	16
into them and	16
the arctic ocean	16
the choice that	16
work out a	16
that has not	16
me what the	16
of our young	16
up with one	16
and the subject	16
so this has	16
is being challenged	16
and i wasnt	16
in our societies	16
going to teach	16
gone too far	16
this one over	16
years that i	16
they think that	16
he came up	16
with our brains	16
future of money	16
minute youll see	16
and these kids	16
its a natural	16
just because we	16
people say things	16
to go quite	16
this is easily	16
you want your	16
the patterns in	16
people who would	16
effects of procrastination	16
like a good	16
sort of think	16
see that entropica	16
i read that	16
at four in	16
i think to	16
of evolution and	16
the lower right	16
not long ago	16
to be vulnerable	16
you can obviously	16
time so we	16
of these companies	16
looking into the	16
went into that	16
believe that you	16
listen to a	16
do to fix	16
i spent my	16
for example the	16
you not to	16
every country in	16
in the east	16
in place and	16
of acceptable behavior	16
about a new	16
directly from this	16
forms of life	16
and then his	16
talk about those	16
right before your	16
before i do	16
a waste of	16
that gives us	16
sitting at the	16
who doesnt know	16
of microbes that	16
eyes wide open	16
solve big problems	16
and that in	16
but theres actually	16
a book that	16
not suggesting that	16
and rightly so	16
is the unknown	16
up for a	16
this means the	16
of magnitude in	16
saying that the	16
we went on	16
what a great	16
just one more	16
the domain of	16
with me to	16
was like the	16
technology that was	16
you come up	16
again on the	16
be that we	16
how well this	16
hardware and software	16
make you a	16
makes no sense	16
to be talking	16
show you here	16
percent of its	16
is a device	16
of color in	16
is a statement	16
in a public	16
we design for	16
that my friends	16
lot of potential	16
described to you	16
not many people	16
i care about	16
up until a	16
you made it	16
that it should	16
sort of in	16
good enough to	16
and as weve	16
on the coast	16
months turned into	16
belief that we	16
distance from the	16
pieces of information	16
gender equality is	16
i will make	16
the world every	16
states and in	16
will say that	16
to access the	16
effect of the	16
they pretty much	16
a big question	16
the cutting edge	16
an open heart	16
it ethical to	16
to evolve the	16
is how to	16
just a simple	16
got the idea	16
and whats really	16
good friend of	16
i ask him	16
to the blockchain	16
you hit the	16
its very powerful	16
statue of liberty	16
ways you can	16
down through the	16
nice thing about	16
really something else	16
a lot because	16
my living room	16
in everyday life	16
it right here	16
and it said	16
of age i	16
to put on	16
twice a day	16
cells in those	16
you go there	16
my left eye	16
on to develop	16
and to change	16
it didnt have	16
do is show	16
say that if	16
that if he	16
between people and	16
and then im	16
i could give	16
you next is	16
would have taken	16
try to think	16
except for one	16
is in that	16
trying to ask	16
a revolution in	16
only for the	16
with it i	16
around the outside	16
the brain when	16
monkey does not	16
of the object	16
much for listening	16
different forms of	16
better future for	16
to generate a	16
and had a	16
me even more	16
the path of	16
you cant say	16
an easy task	16
see in our	16
full range of	16
what you dont	16
been a little	16
it come from	16
of all sorts	16
we thought it	16
work that way	16
when you first	16
him on the	16
who had the	16
people have the	16
far from perfect	16
so you would	16
that shows you	16
about it you	16
a space of	16
my question is	16
actually make these	16
that changed the	16
entropica is broadly	16
would see that	16
as a first	16
the myth of	16
all sort of	16
things in life	16
they are really	16
a serious issue	16
it getting too	16
its the language	16
up and you	16
i listened to	16
existence of a	16
longer just about	16
