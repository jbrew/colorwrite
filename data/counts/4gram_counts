a little bit more	238
and this is what	234
let me tell you	233
and this is the	231
in a way that	230
its going to be	226
all of a sudden	222

a little bit about	213
are going to be	211
i dont want to	205

you think about it	168
of the united states	165

tens of thousands of	162
thank you thank you	162

what im going to	158
on the other side	157
let me give you	157
do you want to	156
i dont know if	155
the size of the	155
in the first place	154
and it turns out	152
im not going to	152
i think this is	152
the united states and	151
to share with you	151
so that we can	151
take a look at	150
to give you a	147
we are going to	147
has to do with	145
going to talk about	145
were going to do	145
so you can see	144
and we need to	144
hundreds of thousands of	143
you can see here	142
this is what we	142
the first time in	141
we have to do	141
im going to tell	139
in the world and	138
and were going to	138
if we want to	138
we look at the	138
some of the most	137
how many of you	137
by the end of	136
i just want to	136
a lot of things	135
the surface of the	135
trying to figure out	135
were going to have	134
we can look at	134
were going to be	133
figure out how to	132
a part of the	132
so how do we	132
to go to the	132
one of the first	131
for all of us	131
and we have to	130
i want to be	130
go back to the	128
a couple of years	128
we need to do	128
talk to you about	127
two and a half	127
are a lot of	126
im going to do	126
and by the way	126
this is a very	126
in new york city	126
to go back to	126
that we have to	125
so i want to	125
will be able to	125
a lot of money	124
there are a lot	124
this is going to	123
the beginning of the	123
the size of a	122
the way that we	122
to come up with	122
one of the reasons	122
turned out to be	121
we live in a	119
in front of the	119
to tell you that	118
have the ability to	117
to look at the	117
those of you who	117
we need to be	117
turns out to be	116
going to be the	116
in front of me	116
was one of the	115
to do with the	115
i dont know what	115
but i want to	114
i want to do	114
i grew up in	114
in terms of the	113
and i think its	112
all the way to	111
this is what i	111
give you an example	110
on the one hand	110
are you going to	110
that this is a	109
and if you look	109
so the question is	109
to figure out what	109
parts of the world	109
and i think thats	108
the center of the	108
the top of the	108
nothing to do with	108
a bit of a	108
what do you do	107
in the context of	107
all around the world	107
the most important thing	107
be one of the	107
at the age of	107
a very long time	106
and every one of	106
in the form of	106
the other side of	106
have to do is	106
the things that we	105
one of my favorite	105
spend a lot of	105
were not going to	105
you a little bit	105
the fact that we	105
might be able to	104
in the case of	104
the bottom of the	104
you want to be	104
in the history of	104
but at the same	104
they were able to	104
a little bit like	104
what that means is	103
as a matter of	103
to do is to	102
to learn how to	102
what was going on	101
to be part of	101
over the course of	101
in the face of	101
so we need to	100
do a lot of	100
why is it that	100
the first one is	100
im going to give	100
rest of the world	100
what it looks like	100
this is the first	100
if you have a	99
for the rest of	99
is not going to	99
i was able to	98
what were going to	98
but it turns out	98
that there is a	98
what we can do	97
so we have to	97
some of you may	97
we can do it	96
as a result of	96
it has to be	96
and i think this	96
what if we could	96
the new york times	96
and all of a	95
should be able to	95
people around the world	95
be able to do	94
theyre going to be	94
the good news is	94
for a very long	94
think of it as	94
in a lot of	93
that were going to	93
we dont want to	93
in the middle east	93
we dont have to	93
is a lot of	93
was going to be	92
doesnt have to be	92
we need to think	92
the first time that	92
that there was a	92
the same way that	91
to be one of	91
with a lot of	91
to be in the	91
that you can see	91
part of the world	91
this is not the	91
for those of you	90
a lot of work	90
the only way to	90
the best way to	90
four in the morning	90
one of them is	90
most of the time	90
and it was a	89
and as a result	89
and that is the	89
i want to share	89
at the university of	89
at the beginning of	88
want to talk to	88
if were going to	88
the only thing that	88
you have to do	88
we have to be	88
i think we need	88
some of them are	88
going to be able	87
people in the world	87
the people who are	87
a matter of fact	87
other side of the	87
and its not just	86
if we look at	86
live in a world	86
that i want to	86
those of us who	86
and you have to	86
be able to see	86
what we need to	85
dont want to be	85
to show you a	85
and i wanted to	85
and the answer is	85
when you think about	85
we want to do	85
so i decided to	85
the problem is that	84
each and every one	84
its not going to	84
end of the day	84
im just going to	84
weve been able to	84
that a lot of	84
you can see how	83
going to have a	83
youre going to see	83
the back of the	83
i have to say	83
you can do it	83
of the most important	83
what you see is	83
in a world where	82
whats going to happen	82
think we need to	82
dont know how to	82
you dont want to	81
the next generation of	81
to talk about the	81
you think about the	81
can look at the	81
what you see here	81
lots and lots of	81
going to give you	80
spent a lot of	80
i think we can	80
the end of this	80
i was a kid	80
in the 21st century	80
in front of you	80
what id like to	80
hundreds of millions of	80
that this is the	80
find a way to	79
every single one of	79
we going to do	79
to tell you a	79
the vast majority of	79
the idea is that	79
at the bottom of	79
in the real world	78
is a picture of	78
the rest of us	77
to get rid of	77
came up with a	77
to the united states	77
the fact that the	77
of thousands of years	77
around the world and	77
i came up with	77
whats going on in	77
i think its a	77
well be able to	76
every one of us	76
that we have a	76
in the solar system	76
were trying to do	76
what do you think	76
and you know what	76
going on in the	76
what can we do	76
its one of the	76
you can see it	75
and this is where	75
are some of the	75
am i going to	75
that you have to	75
you have to be	75
but this is not	75
if we were to	74
now im going to	74
what it means to	74
a whole bunch of	73
and i have to	73
and i think we	73
going to try to	73
i was trying to	73
from all over the	73
but if you look	73
the last few years	73
how do we do	73
to show you the	73
youre not going to	73
the world around us	73
that one of the	73
what do we do	73
on top of the	73
a huge amount of	73
and i realized that	73
in the way that	73
be able to make	73
you can see this	73
country in the world	72
this is something that	72
so were going to	72
in the name of	72
it was the first	72
and so this is	72
want to do is	72
when i was in	72
when we think about	72
to leave you with	72
and its going to	72
this is a picture	72
i dont know how	71
at the top of	71
is that we are	71
and when i was	71
to take care of	71
this is a really	71
i wanted to be	71
get out of the	71
in the developing world	71
what does that mean	71
you want to do	71
what are we going	71
and i dont know	71
so you have to	70
so this is what	70
we dont have a	70
on the surface of	70
year and a half	70
talk a little bit	70
you can think of	70
of the fact that	70
for thousands of years	70
come up with a	70
and i want you	70
percent of the population	70
we can do this	70
are not going to	70
we were going to	69
we dont know how	69
up in the morning	69
so one of the	69
on a daily basis	69
i want to say	69
percent of the time	69
and i was like	69
can see that the	69
it was a very	69
if you were to	69
one of the biggest	69
all over the place	68
what were trying to	68
and this is how	68
as it turns out	68
what happens when you	68
a lot of these	68
is a little bit	68
what we want to	68
a few months ago	68
in the world today	68
i went to the	68
couple of years ago	68
a lot of them	68
and id like to	68
i was a little	68
and a half years	68
when we look at	68
little bit of a	68
it doesnt have to	68
in a different way	67
i think there are	67
see a lot of	67
the sound of the	67
in the world that	67
it allows us to	67
have to deal with	67
the way to the	67
a lot of different	67
the first time i	67
had a lot of	67
need to think about	67
one of the great	66
what does this mean	66
is that we have	66
lets take a look	66
you can see in	66
this is not just	66
we have a lot	66
in order to make	66
is the kind of	66
in the 19th century	66
percent of the worlds	66
and i had a	66
i want to make	66
there are lots of	66
all of these things	66
different parts of the	65
this is just a	65
a whole lot of	65
and i know that	65
we want to be	65
but one of the	65
we can do that	65
about the future of	65
reality as it is	65
in the back of	65
and it was the	65
out of the way	65
that all of us	65
if you dont know	65
are more likely to	65
a couple of weeks	65
i had no idea	65
just a little bit	65
the speed of light	65
this is what it	65
about the size of	65
they were going to	64
we can see the	64
is that this is	64
three and a half	64
what we do is	64
dont get me wrong	64
dont have to be	64
but heres the thing	64
oclock in the morning	64
that im going to	64
i wanted to do	64
you a sense of	64
in the course of	64
here to tell you	64
i want to give	64
at the heart of	64
you can look at	64
and at the same	64
i thought to myself	64
that theyre going to	63
and there was a	63
of the world and	63
but we need to	63
this is what the	63
if you go to	63
the reality is that	63
in the world is	63
can tell you that	63
and some of them	63
of you may have	63
youre going to be	63
to get out of	63
would be able to	63
going to change the	63
we came up with	62
i was in the	62
me give you a	62
the last 20 years	62
to do the same	62
have to tell you	62
do the same thing	62
anywhere in the world	62
you want to know	62
the first thing that	61
and if you think	61
change the way we	61
there are so many	61
and i had to	61
need to be able	61
every one of you	61
have been able to	61
i have to tell	61
want to share with	61
you see here is	61
it seems to me	61
a lot of you	61
and the reason is	61
the international space station	61
its a little bit	61
a piece of paper	61
to think about the	61
have a look at	61
that would be a	61
i think that the	61
it could be a	61
have to look at	61
you dont need to	61
we can change the	60
we really want to	60
and as you can	60
going to do is	60
of the people who	60
i was one of	60
when i went to	60
to the point where	60
the head of the	60
and that was the	60
this is the most	60
what you can see	60
fell in love with	60
i want to know	60
the course of the	60
to make a difference	60
all the way down	60
to go to a	60
be part of the	59
of the 20th century	59
you see on the	59
good news is that	59
we can do is	59
give you a sense	59
have to think about	59
many of you have	59
they need to be	59
you go to the	59
but im going to	59
in the process of	59
and thats exactly what	59
and we know that	59
what we found is	59
want to be a	59
and all of this	59
are the ones that	58
need to do is	58
in the world of	58
the same kind of	58
at the center of	58
if i wanted to	58
and we have a	58
its kind of like	58
a lot of other	58
the laws of physics	58
was the first time	58
you see in the	58
me give you an	58
we had to do	58
is the fact that	58
coming out of the	58
what would happen if	58
we dont know what	58
im going to try	58
that i think is	58
in one of the	58
all kinds of things	58
it used to be	58
thats one of the	58
as soon as i	58
i would say that	58
know how to do	57
for coming to ted	57
all of this is	57
what im saying is	57
i like to think	57
the front of the	57
and we want to	57
what is it that	57
do we do that	57
were going to see	57
and one of my	57
part of the brain	57
i dont know about	57
here you can see	57
at the time of	57
and if we can	57
what do you want	57
tell you a little	57
not a lot of	57
and theyre going to	57
kind of like a	57
of the worlds population	56
the middle of a	56
to remain carbon neutral	56
to live in a	56
what it feels like	56
future freedom of action	56
that the world is	56
in front of a	56
were going to need	56
the name of the	56
im going to go	56
we can do with	56
the things that i	56
a look at this	56
to think about how	56
going to be doing	56
and this is not	56
the last 10 years	56
this is how we	56
so what we did	56
is the most important	56
it means to be	56
in the 20th century	55
that i had to	55
a friend of mine	55
i dont have a	55
if you are a	55
of thousands of people	55
and what you see	55
we have no idea	55
and a half million	55
i think we have	55
lets look at the	55
so what i want	55
an awful lot of	55
is the first time	55
i cant tell you	55
other parts of the	55
to deal with the	55
and over and over	55
been able to do	55
and so on and	55
i was born in	54
were going to go	54
but we have to	54
by the time i	54
id like you to	54
so we had to	54
but i dont think	54
the other way around	54
all sorts of things	54
that its going to	54
and the fact that	54
raise your hand if	54
were going to take	54
the fact that they	54
its very hard to	54
i dont have to	54
are one of the	54
the rest of my	54
to do something about	54
he was going to	54
in front of us	54
over and over and	54
and this was the	54
its not just the	54
and look at the	54
and that is that	54
how do we get	53
i went back to	53
out there in the	53
try to figure out	53
to show you how	53
do something about it	53
that allows us to	53
what i wanted to	53
going to be in	53
what is going on	53
i think theres a	53
i think we all	53
are going to have	53
so lets look at	53
is a kind of	53
it would be a	53
if youre going to	53
be a part of	53
the one on the	53
tons of carbon dioxide	53
so i had to	53
so that they can	53
the truth is that	53
they want to be	53
was written by a	53
if you take a	53
turns out that the	53
despite the fact that	53
you to think about	53
to change the way	52
just a matter of	52
it looks like a	52
to a lot of	52
that we are not	52
you might be thinking	52
have to have a	52
tell you about a	52
they dont want to	52
my colleagues and i	52
and i went to	52
and at the end	52
you want to get	52
is an example of	52
believe it or not	52
i wanted to know	52
they are going to	52
and as youre thinking	52
how to deal with	52
thats a lot of	52
of all of the	51
what we call the	51
a third of the	51
there was a lot	51
in order to get	51
the history of the	51
and theres a lot	51
a group of people	51
in the last few	51
and then we have	51
we have to have	51
i didnt know what	51
a year and a	51
would you like to	51
as well as the	51
want you to think	51
to give you an	51
again and again and	51
and thats what we	51
to talk about a	51
thats exactly what we	51
when we talk about	51
to tell you the	51
want to be the	51
and i think the	51
but i think its	51
a quarter of a	51
this is the kind	51
and a little bit	51
in a matter of	51
we found is that	50
to think about it	50
that we can make	50
going to do it	50
you have to have	50
what this means is	50
that are going to	50
not be able to	50
and we had to	50
a look at the	50
of you who are	50
the next few years	50
i have no idea	50
as part of the	50
at a certain point	50
of a lot of	50
you are going to	50
we dont have the	50
want to do that	50
that means is that	50
i dont think we	50
i dont know why	50
one of the greatest	50
so that you can	50
i had to do	50
the other thing that	50
dont know about you	50
and i started to	50
and if you can	50
we have to make	50
as we know it	50
is that if you	50
to go out and	50
and there is a	49
what were doing is	49
you can see from	49
i look at the	49
how to do that	49
a sense of the	49
we want to make	49
all the things that	49
we all know that	49
and this is why	49
you need to do	49
to get to the	49
able to do that	49
can be used for	49
have no idea how	49
so i went to	49
this is what happens	49
and you want to	49
all over the country	49
im going to take	49
if i were to	49
is that there is	49
i want to go	49
we want to have	49
and thats what i	49
want to do this	49
you so much for	49
we looked at the	48
how is it that	48
tell you about the	48
please raise your hand	48
and because of that	48
a small group of	48
what happens when we	48
there is a lot	48
the people in the	48
much more likely to	48
but what if we	48
make a lot of	48
people are going to	48
we get to the	48
im not talking about	48
what it is that	48
a world in which	48
of people who are	48
and so what we	48
and some of the	48
is not the only	48
have to do with	48
but the problem is	48
a long time ago	48
out to be a	48
the way we think	48
to the fact that	48
promise to remain carbon	48
was a lot of	48
that i wanted to	48
the rest of your	48
what i want you	48
if you wanted to	48
in order to be	48
has a lot of	48
some of the things	48
we know that the	47
its very difficult to	47
theres going to be	47
on the left is	47
are the things that	47
a long time to	47
to change the world	47
that some of the	47
end up with a	47
the heart of the	47
know that there are	47
what we did was	47
want to have a	47
wake up in the	47
if there was a	47
youre going to have	47
80 percent of the	47
i want to leave	47
came up with this	47
is it that we	47
of the solar system	47
the time i was	47
that we have in	47
and i have a	47
know what to do	47
we need to have	47
at all of the	47
billion dollars a year	47
today i want to	47
so many of us	47
the other end of	47
i think it was	47
get a lot of	47
a new way of	47
the power of the	47
to one of the	47
did you know that	46
for the most part	46
i just wanted to	46
want to live in	46
and then you have	46
more likely to be	46
we were trying to	46
of the people in	46
right in the middle	46
you need to be	46
the side of the	46
so you can imagine	46
a map of the	46
a lot of times	46
are they going to	46
the past few years	46
that we live in	46
you dont know what	46
not supposed to be	46
i went to a	46
in the hands of	46
of the things we	46
one of the best	46
to find a way	46
and things like that	46
a lot of it	46
what we found was	46
but the truth is	46
is what it looks	46
its really hard to	46
want to give you	46
so what do we	46
you thank you thank	46
we wanted to do	45
and this is an	45
but you know what	45
the way in which	45
the answer is yes	45
around the world are	45
going to make a	45
how do we make	45
and be able to	45
we have in the	45
going to be like	45
10 percent of the	45
i believe that the	45
it feels like to	45
me tell you about	45
had no idea what	45
we tend to think	45
lot of people who	45
written by a human	45
the first thing i	45
to ask you to	45
how did we get	45
is a map of	45
so if you look	45
he was able to	45
is that you can	45
all of those things	45
that we dont know	45
can go ahead and	45
but there is a	45
but its not just	45
a big part of	45
as youre thinking about	45
and at some point	45
they dont have to	45
like to tell you	45
is something that we	45
and so i think	45
as a way of	45
what i call the	45
thousands and thousands of	45
he told me that	45
what does it mean	45
part of the problem	45
this is kind of	45
it needs to be	45
50 percent of the	45
countries in the world	45
i want to ask	45
i am going to	45
other end of the	45
what it means is	44
the bottom line is	44
that its not just	44
one of the few	44
is part of the	44
will tell you that	44
since i was a	44
the last couple of	44
the first thing we	44
in a world that	44
to the top of	44
was the kind of	44
have to go to	44
in the world to	44
an enormous amount of	44
im going to start	44
you have to make	44
i really wanted to	44
we need to find	44
of this is that	44
some of them were	44
id like to do	44
a lot of us	44
do we have to	44
you might want to	44
how are we going	44
that we dont have	44
im here to tell	44
we are able to	44
i dont think so	44
most of the people	44
grew up in a	44
90 percent of the	44
one of the ways	44
im going to ask	44
at the right time	44
what can i do	44
on the fact that	44
me tell you a	44
the answer to that	44
to be a better	44
one of the largest	44
this is an example	44
from the fact that	44
like this this is	43
and you see the	43
i wanted to go	43
not going to do	43
so we decided to	43
do we want to	43
of millions of people	43
we might be able	43
about the fact that	43
got a lot of	43
at a time when	43
able to do this	43
be able to get	43
and i dont think	43
a new kind of	43
what to do with	43
the fact that i	43
if you dont have	43
of being able to	43
i thought it was	43
a lot of our	43
i really want to	43
with the rest of	43
about 10 years ago	43
and what that means	43
we really need to	43
theyre not going to	43
a lot of good	43
to try to understand	43
the very first time	43
a few years later	43
four and a half	43
so i started to	43
tell you a story	43
you can imagine the	43
that most of us	43
because i want to	43
and you dont have	43
to the rest of	43
want to leave you	43
countries around the world	43
i want to take	43
more than just a	43
on top of that	43
out to be the	43
found a way to	43
for us to be	43
you can see its	43
to say that the	43
can see in the	43
i fell in love	43
what we did is	43
there are thousands of	43
what its like to	43
have to do it	43
percent of the people	43
then you have to	43
and we found that	43
we know how to	42
that i was going	42
and in this case	42
thing i want to	42
so what we do	42
that there is no	42
and in order to	42
is that all of	42
with the help of	42
and the first thing	42
think about how we	42
going to ask you	42
what i mean by	42
the beginning of this	42
put them in a	42
i was looking for	42
id like to talk	42
had nothing to do	42
are going to do	42
many of you are	42
with some of the	42
something to do with	42
a lot of ways	42
fall in love with	42
is not just about	42
but this is the	42
just a bunch of	42
is kind of a	42
to look at a	42
i think we should	42
have the right to	42
that all of you	42
on the basis of	42
going to need to	42
going to do with	42
quarter of a million	42
have to be a	42
20 percent of the	42
youre going to get	42
have to remember that	42
was a little bit	42
this is a little	42
that many of us	42
we live in an	42
what it was like	42
want to be able	42
for a lot of	42
it was just a	42
to create a new	41
the level of the	41
that you need to	41
ive been working on	41
in all of the	41
and what we found	41
about this is that	41
as long as you	41
is that there are	41
what are you doing	41
and the only way	41
lot of work to	41
all of these different	41
a hundred years ago	41
i think that we	41
the fact that its	41
the story of the	41
and there are many	41
and by the time	41
and we can see	41
this means is that	41
you may not know	41
to get into the	41
is going to make	41
this is actually a	41
look at the world	41
to talk a little	41
we need to go	41
as a function of	41
we really have to	41
and these are the	41
how to make it	41
a different kind of	41
things we can do	41
a picture of a	41
they want to do	41
and the question is	41
how to do it	41
so what im going	41
the united states of	41
ive been trying to	41
i didnt want to	41
we have a very	41
i know that i	41
do you know that	41
were going to make	41
a lot of stuff	41
about some of the	41
this is exactly what	41
im going to be	41
you have to remember	41
there will be a	41
you can get a	41
is supposed to be	41
in and out of	41
to think about this	41
the number of people	40
and we can do	40
and so forth and	40
and i think if	40
part of the solution	40
its going to take	40
our promise to remain	40
in the next few	40
so these are the	40
you want to go	40
it turns out its	40
amount of dark energy	40
it a little bit	40
going to talk to	40
so id like to	40
that they have to	40
in the world in	40
so we have a	40
think this is the	40
once upon a time	40
some of you are	40
now this is a	40
the shape of the	40
and you can do	40
so i think that	40
to think of it	40
we need to change	40
the part of the	40
change the way that	40
so the first thing	40
in the midst of	40
that part of the	40
and the idea is	40
over the last few	40
and it will be	40
the hubble space telescope	40
thank you for your	40
united states of america	40
to maximize future freedom	40
in the sense that	40
there were a lot	40
one and a half	40
has nothing to do	40
in the year 2000	40
a wide variety of	40
we can use to	40
here in the united	40
id like to tell	40
middle of the night	40
and then there are	40
i looked at the	40
i thought that was	40
of you in the	40
on to the next	40
no such thing as	40
is a way of	40
doing the same thing	40
but a lot of	40
has the potential to	40
we need to take	40
million tons of carbon	40
maximize future freedom of	40
to some of the	39
more and more people	39
tens of millions of	39
so how can we	39
so we wanted to	39
what we are doing	39
i realized that i	39
were going to get	39
there has been a	39
the kind of thing	39
decided to do something	39
im going to get	39
dont want to do	39
take a step back	39
and thats why i	39
what we need is	39
a few of the	39
in the absence of	39
have no idea what	39
to focus on the	39
of the brain and	39
we think about the	39
you can do this	39
so what is the	39
at the speed of	39
every one of those	39
and i thought that	39
to do with this	39
on the side of	39
you can do that	39
and we wanted to	39
and a half billion	39
going to do this	39
what we have to	39
you can imagine that	39
be able to take	39
the same is true	39
so if you think	39
and i decided to	39
that in order to	39
that theres a lot	39
the last 50 years	39
lot of time in	39
take a moment to	39
when you grow up	39
i was a young	39
and that means that	39
that we can use	39
if i want to	39
you look at this	39
the structure of the	39
what we know about	39
what youre looking at	39
when you have a	39
end of the world	39
that is going to	39
the kinds of things	38
the edge of the	38
people in this room	38
so it turns out	38
we need to make	38
we want to see	38
we dont know the	38
going to take a	38
i was looking at	38
looked at me and	38
have to figure out	38
or something like that	38
this part of the	38
and this is really	38
were looking for a	38
as soon as the	38
and the reason why	38
and when i got	38
so in order to	38
if you think of	38
and turn it into	38
a certain kind of	38
that i dont think	38
and this is all	38
we are in the	38
you may have heard	38
we can have a	38
a couple of examples	38
we dont need to	38
and all of the	38
in such a way	38
in the arab world	38
we want to get	38
that you see here	38
it turned out to	38
we decided to do	38
we have to stop	38
were going to try	38
we are trying to	38
know that if you	38
it in a way	38
of one of the	38
of all of us	38
a lot of my	38
is going to change	38
in ways that we	38
the reason is that	38
to talk about it	38
what if you could	38
is not just a	38
i was the only	38
ill tell you what	38
and this is one	38
which is one of	38
and again and again	38
if you dont like	38
this is a great	37
percent of all the	37
that we can do	37
and i think it	37
and then we can	37
which is a very	37
the president of the	37
of this kind of	37
it seems to be	37
of the most powerful	37
of people in the	37
so what i did	37
so at this point	37
and the thing is	37
but this is a	37
a few weeks later	37
you can go to	37
for hundreds of years	37
the next time you	37
my wife and i	37
id like to share	37
had the opportunity to	37
the end of that	37
out a way to	37
about how we can	37
in order to do	37
in addition to the	37
president of the united	37
going to do something	37
right in front of	37
but we dont have	37
i started thinking about	37
want you to do	37
of whats going on	37
talk to each other	37
put it in a	37
and i have been	37
do this kind of	37
in the early days	37
like to think of	37
and i just want	37
im not saying that	37
think this is a	37
as youre thinking of	37
a lot more than	37
i have to do	37
this is what you	37
and to do that	37
in the words of	37
make sure that we	37
wanted to be a	37
as a kind of	37
were going to use	37
from around the world	37
and as soon as	37
not a part of	37
so i wanted to	37
so i think we	37
tell you that the	37
would be a good	37
we need to start	37
we have the ability	37
lets go back to	37
but its not the	37
how to do this	37
of the reasons why	37
all of us are	37
over the next few	37
from the perspective of	36
the fact that you	36
going to get the	36
you want to make	36
an example of a	36
what can you do	36
about a third of	36
people all over the	36
we want to understand	36
in the center of	36
being able to do	36
that we had to	36
i think there is	36
this is where we	36
the first is that	36
able to look at	36
you can make a	36
which is that we	36
i want to start	36
have to worry about	36
figured out how to	36
of the 19th century	36
that allow us to	36
just a few years	36
in the way we	36
and all the other	36
wanted to do was	36
you some of the	36
and it has a	36
is what happens when	36
i used to be	36
want to know what	36
i invite you to	36
in new york and	36
part of the story	36
out of the water	36
a lot of information	36
surface of the brain	36
this is why we	36
so on and so	36
want to know why	36
so if you want	36
we can start to	36
we just need to	36
so let me show	36
way of thinking about	36
dont know if you	36
of the things i	36
so if we want	36
30 percent of the	36
we dont have any	36
there was no way	36
in the sense of	36
and i believe that	36
a lot of that	36
continue to improve our	36
a lot of fun	36
to come back to	36
in a way thats	36
what you want to	36
that we have the	36
of millions of dollars	36
what they were doing	36
the base of the	36
were a lot of	36
im going to share	36
and that is why	36
that we want to	36
is the idea of	36
the only thing i	36
in the morning and	36
one percent of the	36
but i can tell	36
want to focus on	36
rest of my life	36
to find out how	36
the fact that it	35
and i said to	35
and the other one	35
the end of a	35
you cant do that	35
to do in the	35
but the thing is	35
is that when you	35
what would you say	35
but its not enough	35
to make sense of	35
turn out to be	35
were more likely to	35
the models are skillful	35
was one of those	35
had to do was	35
seven and a half	35
going to make it	35
is it going to	35
a few weeks ago	35
to show you is	35
whether or not they	35
it was a great	35
and we dont have	35
is it possible to	35
the fact that this	35
how do you do	35
you see behind me	35
these are the things	35
you an example of	35
want to know how	35
the answer is no	35
want to look at	35
at the level of	35
in the way of	35
know what it is	35
know who you are	35
i think thats a	35
we can begin to	35
wanted to make a	35
its got to be	35
how were going to	35
the second thing that	35
going to take you	35
this is a map	35
you can see a	35
something as simple as	35
in terms of how	35
long way to go	35
is going to go	35
the last two years	35
a couple of months	35
going to be very	35
im going to have	35
going to go through	35
i spent a lot	35
i was growing up	35
i like to call	35
one thing that i	35
with each other and	35
the people that we	35
the thing is that	35
this is the same	35
this is the only	35
you know what i	35
many of them are	35
that i think we	35
so all of these	35
you might think that	35
of people around the	35
you for coming to	35
and the reason for	35
and of course the	35
so in other words	35
you want to see	35
just a couple of	35
we also need to	35
a great deal of	35
all you have to	35
all the way up	35
70 hours of tv	35
they didnt want to	34
quite a lot of	34
then we have to	34
and we think that	34
going to go on	34
thats going to be	34
on the right is	34
like to share with	34
one of the other	34
where we are today	34
way we think about	34
and if you dont	34
with the idea of	34
people on the planet	34
not going to get	34
each one of us	34
come out of the	34
we would like to	34
a whole series of	34
this is a new	34
come to believe that	34
to let go of	34
a tremendous amount of	34
the first person to	34
a couple years ago	34
because it turns out	34
it was going to	34
very similar to the	34
like a lot of	34
what we call a	34
is that its not	34
one of those things	34
way that we can	34
that the people who	34
we can learn from	34
and i was in	34
and i think you	34
the tip of the	34
us a lot of	34
how to make a	34
think thats going to	34
next to each other	34
the first hour of	34
for a couple of	34
let me talk about	34
and there are a	34
that this is not	34
one of the problems	34
to say that i	34
a little bit better	34
was the end of	34
there is not a	34
the idea that we	34
trying to do is	34
done a lot of	34
a kind of a	34
going to go to	34
and it is a	34
at some point in	34
i found myself in	34
that there are no	34
are less likely to	34
but the point is	34
all of you to	34
the world and i	34
some of the worlds	34
theyre more likely to	34
be a little bit	34
my job is to	34
but when it comes	34
25 percent of the	34
a long way to	34
to each other and	34
you may have seen	34
dont know what it	34
to be a little	34
we do is we	34
but were going to	34
thank you for coming	34
they came up with	34
got to be a	34
it was one of	34
of all of those	34
and more and more	34
want them to be	34
and the reason that	34
think of this as	34
are not supposed to	34
to show you what	34
the face of the	34
dont have access to	34
after world war ii	34
but it was also	33
thats what we do	33
the second world war	33
were talking about the	33
the next 20 years	33
theres all kinds of	33
we can see that	33
that it would be	33
and i can tell	33
i would argue that	33
a bit like a	33
the world is a	33
part of the answer	33
sort of like the	33
the reason why i	33
and it turned out	33
a couple of things	33
know whats going on	33
what you need to	33
when you were a	33
up to me and	33
do it in a	33
as we get older	33
what youre going to	33
the world that we	33
i didnt have to	33
is that we can	33
we need to know	33
and he told me	33
and a half minutes	33
think we have to	33
to show you now	33
as a way to	33
are a couple of	33
the other one is	33
not going to go	33
you know what im	33
at the expense of	33
on the back of	33
want to do it	33
the things that are	33
how can it be	33
see if you can	33
think a lot of	33
wouldnt be able to	33
it turned out that	33
want to be when	33
around the world that	33
if you can see	33
i have a lot	33
in the long run	33
what did you do	33
its not just about	33
we should be able	33
we were looking for	33
was a little kid	33
that i think are	33
at the other end	33
to allow us to	33
to try to make	33
for me to be	33
and the rest of	33
of some of the	33
it will take us	33
think that this is	33
what im talking about	33
place in the world	33
can go to the	33
what do you see	33
is that theres a	33
learned a lot about	33
there are a few	33
i would love to	33
a little bit different	33
this is what makes	33
you look at it	33
as you all know	33
you need to know	33
on the verge of	33
is that the brain	33
way to think about	33
to the end of	33
and one of them	33
about the power of	33
its a very simple	33
would have to be	33
never be able to	33
i dont want you	33
as you can imagine	33
and the result is	33
a variety of different	33
are not the only	33
just to give you	33
go all the way	33
we find ourselves in	33
that they want to	33
60 percent of the	32
that it is possible	32
to be on the	32
the first part of	32
in a very different	32
and a half ago	32
this is not an	32
the hands of the	32
the people who have	32
figuring out how to	32
now were going to	32
in just a few	32
and some of you	32
to be the first	32
so i think its	32
i dont think thats	32
i would have to	32
that the brain is	32
the same amount of	32
to tell you what	32
all you need is	32
there are people who	32
to think about what	32
is one of my	32
the reason for that	32
time for us to	32
im going to describe	32
in some of the	32
little bit about how	32
the way down to	32
you can see what	32
to be the case	32
put it into a	32
to come out of	32
need to go to	32
that was the first	32
the rate at which	32
all of these people	32
look at all of	32
i am not a	32
there are hundreds of	32
you can have a	32
the idea of the	32
are the kinds of	32
the case of the	32
to show you some	32
to enhance a human	32
is a set of	32
so what do you	32
i set out to	32
but i have a	32
and in the process	32
i think i was	32
all the time and	32
the end of my	32
this this is a	32
on the order of	32
in the western world	32
here we see entropica	32
that most of the	32
one of the oldest	32
i will tell you	32
to solve this problem	32
share with you a	32
want to do something	32
going back to the	32
is to be able	32
its very important to	32
i did not know	32
who were dealing with	32
all the way back	32
have to trust the	32
that we will be	32
do the right thing	32
to get them to	32
very much thank you	32
that i have to	32
in the summer of	32
i felt like i	32
how do you get	32
for all of the	32
enhance a human body	32
we had no idea	32
in the us and	31
if any of you	31
were going to start	31
that were trying to	31
we have to look	31
we can go to	31
i dont think that	31
you have to look	31
they want to know	31
and there was no	31
in an age of	31
up in the air	31
i will never forget	31
want to make a	31
when you think of	31
are going to look	31
by the time we	31
for millions of years	31
are just a few	31
and in a way	31
now we have a	31
to you today about	31
all sorts of other	31
i dont have the	31
i learned a lot	31
i dont think this	31
that can be used	31
even if you dont	31
of the 21st century	31
as quickly as possible	31
tell you that i	31
during world war ii	31
if you think that	31
when you try to	31
you have to think	31
millions and millions of	31
figure out a way	31
with this kind of	31
so thats what we	31
the united states has	31
and the way we	31
in the new york	31
but what about the	31
the gulf of mexico	31
this is just one	31
all of us and	31
are the people who	31
it turns out the	31
and if you want	31
by the name of	31
lot of people are	31
years ago when i	31
of the most exciting	31
to be when you	31
i wanted to make	31
going to see the	31
didnt know what to	31
four oclock in the	31
and i used to	31
these are some of	31
you have to get	31
in the world its	31
the quality of the	31
to do something that	31
and this kind of	31
we have to find	31
be able to look	31
to try to figure	31
to be the only	31
on the left side	31
we take for granted	31
and i began to	31
not going to change	31
and thats what im	31
because they dont have	31
so this is where	31
some of you might	31
to pay attention to	31
to give you some	31
as soon as we	31
and i think there	31
get rid of the	31
so thats what i	31
this is just the	31
to do now is	31
in our solar system	31
to explain to you	31
in the last decade	31
can do a lot	31
over the long term	31
a new type of	31
to the next level	31
a member of the	31
here in the us	31
it turns out to	31
be when you grow	31
share with you today	31
my students and i	31
but in the end	31
it is possible to	31
need to have a	31
we have to think	31
because you have to	31
i have to admit	31
had to deal with	31
is what we call	31
a certain amount of	31
dont know what the	31
we also have to	31
it would have been	31
of the most successful	31
and at the time	31
the beginning of a	31
about it is that	31
and all of us	31
so what you see	31
when i look at	31
what i think is	31
can do about it	31
you have to use	31
the future of the	31
and we dont know	31
but we also have	31
what it meant to	31
to keep in mind	31
one of the main	31
early in the morning	31
weve been working on	31
do you know what	31
its also going to	31
that i showed you	31
we dont really know	31
we can think of	31
to do it and	31
is that most of	31
and on top of	31
and i think i	31
had a chance to	30
be able to have	30
youll be able to	30
i want them to	30
rest of your life	30
as much as i	30
about a year and	30
this kind of thing	30
the point is that	30
a lot more about	30
because we know that	30
and the number of	30
and thats the reason	30
then were going to	30
we could do it	30
in the first hour	30
and its a very	30
tend to think of	30
you just have to	30
and i looked at	30
what would you do	30
our form of life	30
it all the way	30
never going to be	30
from one of the	30
here we have a	30
of our solar system	30
closer and closer to	30
and a half hours	30
have a lot to	30
the first of these	30
is that it is	30
the world but we	30
and the reason i	30
going to get a	30
a couple of days	30
we have to go	30
the hearts and minds	30
work that we do	30
we wanted to know	30
is a bit of	30
this all the time	30
this was the first	30
three dimensions of space	30
than you are in	30
we dont really understand	30
and at that point	30
i think it is	30
way to do it	30
im going to put	30
and i hope that	30
of the people that	30
so what that means	30
want to say that	30
at least in the	30
the amount of dark	30
a world that is	30
how we think about	30
when i think about	30
facial blood flow changes	30
the next 10 years	30
that the earth is	30
off the coast of	30
theres something wrong with	30
if you were a	30
cant tell you how	30
im going to play	30
can think of it	30
this kind of work	30
not just in the	30
of it as a	30
we will be able	30
keep in mind that	30
as opposed to the	30
the reason why we	30
24 hours a day	30
they have to do	30
know what it feels	30
to go into the	30
were in the first	30
the time of the	30
and this is called	30
the behavior of the	30
is to try to	30
and if you have	30
so whats going on	30
im going to say	30
in the last year	30
and i was so	30
ha ha ha ha	30
we spend a lot	30
i have a question	30
at some of the	30
why do we have	30
which is to say	30
that we see in	30
trying to understand the	30
and that was a	30
i think a lot	30
is going to take	30
because i wanted to	30
i think one of	30
smarter than you are	30
i want to get	30
on top of it	30
watts per square meter	30
when you go to	30
what you see in	30
that it was a	30
in the opposite direction	30
and i dont have	30
in the spinal cord	29
exactly the same thing	29
have access to the	29
how does it work	29
ways in which we	29
the last five years	29
we did is we	29
ways that we can	29
when i was growing	29
want to do with	29
brings me to the	29
able to see the	29
it has to do	29
im going to use	29
you in the audience	29
many of you will	29
to answer the question	29
we dont talk about	29
so this was a	29
come back to the	29
doesnt make any sense	29
it had to be	29
that there are many	29
that they need to	29
the only ones who	29
as one of the	29
and how we can	29
want it to be	29
anything to do with	29
it is not a	29
map of the world	29
what we find is	29
here are some of	29
it was the most	29
and when you have	29
which is why we	29
what do we have	29
i knew i had	29
that you see in	29
that they were going	29
what im trying to	29
that i had been	29
i thought i was	29
here this is a	29
i dont know i	29
time in my life	29
of the spinal cord	29
across the united states	29
every one of them	29
the fact is that	29
to get away from	29
long period of time	29
we found was that	29
the same way as	29
dont want you to	29
let me take you	29
to see that the	29
it out of the	29
in a little bit	29
had the courage to	29
the idea that the	29
what we see is	29
so what are we	29
on a piece of	29
to go to school	29
and it would be	29
and i had this	29
to get a job	29
to take responsibility for	29
takes a lot of	29
going to do that	29
the speed of sound	29
lot of people in	29
that sort of thing	29
a half billion years	29
i thought about it	29
they were trying to	29
now i want to	29
how do we know	29
in the world the	29
to find ways to	29
a lot of research	29
take a closer look	29
with that in mind	29
to the bottom of	29
this is the moment	29
and this is something	29
but how do we	29
people who are in	29
think one of the	29
and in some cases	29
out of the house	29
a lot of human	29
were all going to	29
have to do something	29
and so we started	29
in order to understand	29
parts of the brain	29
its a kind of	29
can it be that	29
and youre going to	29
things that we need	29
we asked them to	29
more than half of	29
is the size of	29
we are not the	29
to see if we	29
but that doesnt mean	29
this is called the	29
i had a very	29
this is a big	29
this is a bit	29
are a number of	29
was the beginning of	29
the reality of the	29
but as soon as	29
of the middle east	29
were going to talk	29
what do i mean	29
i realized that the	29
of them is that	29
for more than a	29
you have to go	28
as much as we	28
one on the left	28
we want to know	28
we know that there	28
to figure out if	28
it can be a	28
be able to be	28
been a lot of	28
just a few of	28
and i was really	28
in the short term	28
people who are not	28
to do that is	28
that can do this	28
to be the same	28
by far the most	28
think were going to	28
so the idea is	28
this is part of	28
you very much thank	28
thats the kind of	28
what were looking for	28
important to remember that	28
we are part of	28
each one of these	28
it tells us that	28
were going to build	28
we have to recognize	28
men and women who	28
the criminal justice system	28
000 rides per day	28
up in front of	28
its a lot of	28
single one of them	28
of one of these	28
and there is no	28
of the most famous	28
part of the body	28
all the way across	28
a large number of	28
what they want to	28
for those of us	28
in the developed world	28
going to help us	28
some of the other	28
the theory of evolution	28
little bit about the	28
whats happening in the	28
of the worlds most	28
i decided that i	28
life on this planet	28
in the lives of	28
is not the same	28
idea is that the	28
came up with the	28
so what can we	28
reason for that is	28
as if it were	28
dont have time to	28
are the ones who	28
at a very early	28
one of the big	28
for as long as	28
a number of things	28
out of every 10	28
and that is what	28
because it was a	28
one way or another	28
if you have the	28
we are the only	28
this is a question	28
there are a couple	28
that i would be	28
each of these different	28
going to continue to	28
us out of the	28
do you think that	28
and most of the	28
that i grew up	28
only way to get	28
around the world it	28
its a way of	28
this is where it	28
to all of the	28
want you to take	28
view of the world	28
you very much for	28
going to be really	28
its not just a	28
we can do about	28
to talk about is	28
the next five years	28
it turns out there	28
i can see the	28
if youre trying to	28
it doesnt really matter	28
thats what we did	28
so this is an	28
when i got to	28
thats what i want	28
thats not going to	28
there have been a	28
be able to build	28
thats how it works	28
the things that you	28
if we could do	28
dont want to see	28
to introduce you to	28
you can see two	28
number of people who	28
and when you get	28
me show you how	28
does this mean for	28
on the edge of	28
the state of the	28
and the idea was	28
the middle east and	28
so there is no	28
a result of that	28
a whole lot more	28
things that i think	28
the wizard of oz	28
get a sense of	28
that it is a	28
as if they were	28
talk to you today	28
is that if we	28
about the nature of	28
we can take the	28
a result of the	28
wait for them to	28
that kind of stuff	28
it was in the	28
that we use to	28
is so much more	28
be able to tell	28
through a lot of	28
and this is because	28
were going to give	28
going to look like	28
is made up of	28
is the sound of	28
and not only that	28
you to do is	28
for the future of	28
because there is no	28
these are people who	28
whats really going on	28
i decided to do	28
and a couple of	28
i found out that	28
so that we could	28
we have to get	28
and then the next	28
what is it about	27
same way that we	27
isnt going to be	27
have a sense of	27
the surface of mars	27
have the power to	27
one of the people	27
can see from the	27
how are you going	27
that comes from the	27
as you get older	27
and when you look	27
that this is what	27
have to go back	27
this is how the	27
to show you two	27
thank you for listening	27
i think thats going	27
we have in our	27
the civil rights movement	27
one of them was	27
times the speed of	27
going to be an	27
one of you is	27
going to try and	27
that it could be	27
they tend to be	27
i decided to make	27
and then you get	27
last couple of years	27
have an impact on	27
its a story about	27
want to get to	27
and the way that	27
and many of the	27
the difference between the	27
to ask the question	27
order to do that	27
build machines that are	27
its much more like	27
by the time you	27
some of you will	27
meant to be a	27
but it was a	27
to do with it	27
that people who are	27
all walks of life	27
of work to do	27
and put it in	27
there are many people	27
the past 10 years	27
not the only thing	27
i know what it	27
and we can use	27
im going to spend	27
as far as i	27
in the rest of	27
part of the reason	27
in the past and	27
brings me to my	27
this is the best	27
we can create a	27
important for us to	27
the world trade center	27
have nothing to hide	27
sorts of things that	27
are going to get	27
need in order to	27
it is going to	27
i just told you	27
what they do is	27
if you live in	27
to the size of	27
go on and on	27
i said to myself	27
in the last two	27
me show you what	27
but thats not what	27
what you can do	27
of you out there	27
be part of this	27
this is the way	27
end of the story	27
so what does this	27
were able to get	27
what youre seeing here	27
i think the answer	27
the other side so	27
it this is a	27
and a bunch of	27
the fact that there	27
all of us have	27
white picket fence and	27
so in my lab	27
i dont even know	27
want to take a	27
look at some of	27
at a young age	27
so theres a lot	27
to get access to	27
i believe that we	27
make the world a	27
if i was to	27
we will need to	27
which you can see	27
the idea was to	27
going to see a	27
little bit like the	27
the world economic forum	27
youre going to do	27
to a point where	27
a great way to	27
she looked at me	27
took a lot of	27
the future of work	27
and they had to	27
used to be a	27
the brain of a	27
not a question of	27
i had to be	27
we have got to	27
person in this room	27
what i call a	27
look back at the	27
that we were able	27
it might just be	27
to look at this	27
to the other side	27
is a good thing	27
one on the right	27
when you do this	27
have the capacity to	27
and ill show you	27
so this is my	27
and the problem is	27
people who have a	27
to show you that	27
you for your attention	27
see if we can	27
of the physical world	27
who we are and	27
i got to the	27
how many people here	27
the things that make	27
need to figure out	27
what we have is	27
over the last couple	27
on and so forth	27
and all sorts of	27
a way to make	27
as long as we	27
for a number of	27
and then we ask	27
to be a very	27
so let me tell	27
ways that we cant	27
in what we call	27
ill give you an	27
for us to do	27
it looks like this	27
we can get a	27
realized that there was	27
if i had to	27
when we looked at	27
it means that we	27
to me and said	27
in the past decade	27
is what we want	27
about what it means	27
so i have to	27
there is a very	27
and if you go	27
as much as the	27
to do that i	27
in the early 90s	27
the world this is	27
in the human brain	27
the future of our	27
are a little bit	27
you can go ahead	27
to make the world	27
had to go to	27
what do i think	27
answer to this question	27
didnt want to be	27
the form of a	26
to make sure we	26
going to allow us	26
little bit of the	26
the first day of	26
of people who have	26
have to admit that	26
places in the world	26
that came out of	26
and he said to	26
is the essence of	26
we need is a	26
is the only place	26
do you think of	26
in love with the	26
but you have to	26
a number of years	26
and you see that	26
the same way they	26
you to look at	26
give you a little	26
to see a lot	26
imagine a world where	26
but it doesnt have	26
the way the world	26
that we are going	26
and i got a	26
and i dont want	26
have to do that	26
spend the rest of	26
it was possible to	26
know the answer to	26
a small number of	26
the first time the	26
to come to the	26
to be aware of	26
to do this is	26
and its important to	26
then we have a	26
is a story about	26
can we do to	26
the interesting thing about	26
the extent to which	26
to where i was	26
so i like to	26
in the world for	26
get up in the	26
to be doing it	26
a few of them	26
the same thing that	26
we went to the	26
for the very first	26
what i was doing	26
we could look at	26
the world would be	26
not only in the	26
for the past few	26
on top of a	26
years ago i was	26
about a quarter of	26
you have to keep	26
the key thing is	26
go down to the	26
we seem to be	26
one of my favorites	26
you know how to	26
and the truth is	26
and if youre a	26
whats going on here	26
in the universe and	26
like to think that	26
there are a number	26
to say that we	26
that this kind of	26
because this is the	26
the first one was	26
see if we could	26
is the story of	26
all of those are	26
you get the idea	26
because this is a	26
was not going to	26
be able to use	26
is the idea that	26
the reason for this	26
but i want you	26
and it was very	26
how do you know	26
theyre going to do	26
every now and then	26
the fact that he	26
we can make a	26
from the united states	26
to tell you how	26
to do the right	26
were in the middle	26
one of these things	26
a way that is	26
and i asked them	26
one of them and	26
would be willing to	26
and we were really	26
point i want to	26
when i go to	26
is that in the	26
just at the beginning	26
if it were a	26
one third of the	26
of the world around	26
we were talking about	26
a quarter of the	26
you want to have	26
and the way i	26
how much do you	26
tell the difference between	26
the design of the	26
a few months later	26
can change the world	26
in the right way	26
any of the other	26
the past six years	26
from the ground up	26
this for a while	26
from each other and	26
most of them are	26
and you get a	26
and then i thought	26
wont be able to	26
you an idea of	26
out that if you	26
we have to change	26
in a few years	26
and i thought to	26
they dont have the	26
you want me to	26
you really want to	26
there is no way	26
one of the key	26
the war on terror	26
ill give you a	26
to be a good	26
what were talking about	26
in the brain and	26
more complicated than that	26
exactly what we did	26
of the first things	26
to talk about today	26
to see the world	26
us to be able	26
into the solar system	26
and i would like	26
is going to happen	26
once in a while	26
the world of the	26
in the middle and	26
of the other things	26
think that we can	26
to all of us	26
la li la la	26
as much as you	26
but at the end	26
i dont think i	26
what happens when the	26
with one of the	26
hands up if you	26
a few days later	26
this is what they	26
heres an example of	26
to try and understand	26
on a global scale	26
and you might be	26
the nature of the	26
you what i mean	26
that has to be	26
to find the right	26
some parts of the	26
to understand how this	26
had a couple of	26
of what we do	26
is that when we	26
all of these are	26
me that i was	26
was seven years old	26
little bit more about	26
to work with the	26
do all kinds of	26
to try to find	26
20 years from now	26
you know what the	26
the back of my	26
i decided to write	25
thing you can do	25
there would be no	25
are going to see	25
going to do a	25
so when i was	25
all you need to	25
the idea is to	25
so its a very	25
back into the atmosphere	25
and there are some	25
that we have today	25
im here to talk	25
i think its the	25
that i describe as	25
that you can do	25
we need a new	25
im sure many of	25
but this is what	25
not all of them	25
its the equivalent of	25
a sense of what	25
have the opportunity to	25
three shows in production	25
that would be the	25
and i can go	25
you may be thinking	25
comes out of the	25
i want to see	25
i describe as a	25
but thats not all	25
of the kind of	25
that all of this	25
lets start with a	25
we just dont have	25
and they are going	25
so let me give	25
the result of a	25
so here we have	25
the right side of	25
shows in production at	25
just a few examples	25
a story of how	25
its kind of a	25
is the only way	25
where are you now	25
so many of the	25
it doesnt mean that	25
in the last 10	25
that youre going to	25
have this kind of	25
have to rely on	25
in one of these	25
and each of these	25
men and women are	25
everyone in this room	25
can come up with	25
i want to live	25
do whatever it takes	25
that we didnt know	25
i was asked to	25
i call it the	25
all of us to	25
just a few months	25
of the rest of	25
and the more i	25
if you had a	25
and heres the thing	25
going to be one	25
going to happen and	25
thing is that we	25
a fraction of a	25
is a very simple	25
this mean for the	25
because we live in	25
that id like to	25
i was thinking about	25
we put them in	25
40 percent of the	25
to try to get	25
some of you have	25
to the one that	25
was a little girl	25
exactly the same way	25
want to think about	25
that we should be	25
us to think about	25
were going to put	25
i looked at it	25
to be a great	25
a year or two	25
say you want to	25
came out of the	25
in exactly the same	25
want you to tell	25
because they want to	25
of this as a	25
and what they found	25
and i know this	25
this is not about	25
similar to the one	25
to be much more	25
have to be able	25
here to talk about	25
thats what i did	25
have the courage to	25
but there are a	25
going to start to	25
at me and said	25
push a button and	25
this is probably the	25
to think about is	25
i began to think	25
the same thing with	25
but in this case	25
going to look at	25
and the kind of	25
this is a good	25
hundreds and hundreds of	25
and figure out how	25
right thing to do	25
over the past few	25
i wish i could	25
and it has to	25
and then you see	25
so that i could	25
i grew up with	25
that there might be	25
of those who are	25
you were going to	25
production at a time	25
the world and the	25
take you on a	25
more and more of	25
some people will choose	25
people will choose to	25
think about how to	25
we now know that	25
experience that i describe	25
the world right now	25
which i think is	25
made a lot of	25
i was working on	25
the chemistry of the	25
to the surface and	25
about the importance of	25
you will see that	25
so all of this	25
the people who were	25
less than one percent	25
the real hum is	25
what happens is that	25
we have to deal	25
that i didnt know	25
but you can see	25
years of my life	25
on the idea of	25
things that we do	25
and one of those	25
way that i could	25
what i do is	25
and we all know	25
when i first saw	25
the right thing to	25
the only way we	25
and all of these	25
in terms of being	25
with a bunch of	25
its a good thing	25
do i want to	25
and many of them	25
i going to get	25
and this is just	25
its very easy to	25
the more i play	25
show you an example	25
we need to see	25
what are you going	25
in this particular case	25
and on the right	25
of you in this	25
grew up in the	25
lets start with the	25
we went back to	25
in the eyes of	25
a long time and	25
at the edge of	25
always going to be	25
all the people who	25
in production at a	25
if we can get	25
had to do with	24
to tell the story	24
you know how much	24
used to be the	24
75 percent of the	24
get back to that	24
voice in my work	24
what would it look	24
the majority of the	24
are a part of	24
like to be a	24
there are only three	24
and i found that	24
let me start with	24
so theyre going to	24
i dont need to	24
we do know that	24
by looking at the	24
for the last 10	24
this is only one	24
we have to fight	24
of the united nations	24
but its also a	24
they have the same	24
you can see on	24
most of us are	24
and you can also	24
going to happen to	24
the work that we	24
i think if you	24
was one of them	24
you can see is	24
what happens to the	24
youre seeing here is	24
did we get here	24
that if we dont	24
the same time as	24
is this a new	24
is a wonderful thing	24
but in order to	24
the world health organization	24
thousands of people in	24
a small amount of	24
at the very least	24
but we are not	24
youve got to go	24
what we were doing	24
i dont think its	24
that turned out to	24
dont have to have	24
and they need to	24
to talk about that	24
and this is in	24
for some of the	24
the context of a	24
all of the people	24
have a right to	24
one of the worlds	24
is a very important	24
not being able to	24
are supposed to be	24
to answer that question	24
that allowed us to	24
tell you about some	24
the first time we	24
about the end of	24
through the lens of	24
a cup of coffee	24
will allow us to	24
to make it so	24
the middle of nowhere	24
the united states is	24
and what i found	24
of us in this	24
just to show you	24
you might be able	24
it comes to the	24
do what i do	24
doing a lot of	24
of the number of	24
its supposed to be	24
your hand if you	24
and they have a	24
is a matter of	24
use a lot of	24
the nobel prize for	24
the story of a	24
to deal with that	24
first time in my	24
trying to do the	24
going to share with	24
so this is not	24
and make sure that	24
sense to be doing	24
story of how we	24
it all the time	24
it is the most	24
a couple of questions	24
of the world that	24
you were a kid	24
and so what that	24
the large hadron collider	24
we now have a	24
there was a time	24
all of the worlds	24
that you want to	24
i think is a	24
in the next 10	24
all of us in	24
that we think about	24
and here it is	24
thing we can do	24
sure many of you	24
make an effort to	24
that we are all	24
to figure out the	24
and we can evolve	24
dont have a good	24
in the air and	24
and it seems to	24
thats why we are	24
the same time that	24
because of climate change	24
and i was just	24
about 10 percent of	24
the way that it	24
much more than the	24
got a phone call	24
i had a lot	24
and around the world	24
he looked at me	24
not the only ones	24
and we have the	24
one of the major	24
i really think that	24
that we could do	24
which is kind of	24
we have lots of	24
that is to say	24
now we have the	24
is kind of like	24
you can take the	24
like to leave you	24
and thats how we	24
and weve got to	24
the first thing is	24
was going to happen	24
that there are some	24
get integrated into the	24
but if you are	24
if you look in	24
you want to enhance	24
the surface of a	24
is just the beginning	24
of the human body	24
but it is not	24
you can also see	24
no one has ever	24
up if you think	24
we need to look	24
and our ability to	24
to the back of	24
you may be wondering	24
is we have to	24
we started with a	24
want you to know	24
world we live in	24
we need to understand	24
to know how to	24
we didnt know we	24
things that make us	24
would it look like	24
that it was the	24
you look at all	24
in a couple of	24
the same as the	24
the end of it	24
doesnt know how to	24
but how do you	24
there are many other	24
going to make the	24
that they are not	24
in other parts of	24
at the core of	24
in the world we	24
and it is the	24
that were listening to	24
do i mean by	24
the day of the	24
and i had no	24
we need to stop	24
see that theres a	24
who care about our	24
camera and on the	24
to arts and culture	24
if you had to	24
to be very careful	24
so this is our	24
is an image of	24
you die drop it	24
what do i do	24
i always wanted to	24
because we want to	24
the ios of the	24
you would have to	24
when i woke up	24
i wanted to buy	24
the world in the	24
and the other is	24
this is an image	24
so i want you	24
in different parts of	24
when youre talking about	24
take you back to	24
want to ask you	24
with the ability to	24
by a factor of	24
able to make a	24
the rules of the	24
and in the middle	24
and think about the	24
the same time i	24
and how do you	24
but it would be	24
and think about what	24
want to go to	24
all life on earth	24
it was an amazing	24
i need you to	24
this is the face	24
its exactly the same	24
are actually going to	24
in the field of	24
and how do we	24
know a lot of	24
same is true of	24
can do it in	24
in the world i	24
many of the people	24
nine out of every	24
and that would be	24
and here we are	24
i was part of	23
can do it with	23
you to tell me	23
i think all of	23
do not want to	23
the only animals that	23
you look at that	23
things are going to	23
and for the first	23
what weve been doing	23
is no such thing	23
is that i think	23
to talk about what	23
of the world where	23
around the world to	23
just the tip of	23
is the result of	23
we all have a	23
to the front of	23
know a little bit	23
that come from the	23
some of these things	23
you get to the	23
have a lot more	23
so here are some	23
so what id like	23
and so on but	23
i was seven years	23
if im going to	23
as soon as possible	23
change the way you	23
that we have and	23
the only one who	23
all these things that	23
play a video game	23
of time in the	23
a lot to do	23
and i look at	23
whats the use of	23
an integral part of	23
we got to the	23
in order to help	23
have to be that	23
right next to the	23
it can be used	23
a picture of the	23
of the matter is	23
the things that weve	23
of these things are	23
a lot more people	23
when you consider that	23
the question of whether	23
do you think the	23
tell you how many	23
these are all the	23
and lo and behold	23
were going to learn	23
end of the year	23
that if you look	23
to have a lot	23
little bit of time	23
i cannot tell you	23
the next 15 years	23
not been able to	23
this over and over	23
do you know how	23
in the world are	23
the next thing is	23
and if we dont	23
a colleague of mine	23
and the good news	23
probably going to be	23
go to one of	23
more likely to get	23
probably the most important	23
when i talk about	23
an image of a	23
when i have a	23
its sort of like	23
can make a difference	23
its a very interesting	23
because in the end	23
and he had a	23
pretty much the same	23
for all sorts of	23
to show you one	23
you to know that	23
the way back to	23
a lot about the	23
all the time but	23
it felt like a	23
thing that makes us	23
to know about the	23
out how to get	23
bottom of the ocean	23
the speed of the	23
getting in the way	23
to start with the	23
and this is actually	23
this is a photograph	23
of the brain that	23
some of the data	23
the last 30 years	23
but when you look	23
as much as possible	23
how do i know	23
a lot of data	23
would like to do	23
on the vertical axis	23
of you have seen	23
at the time when	23
you can change the	23
it means is that	23
that we have not	23
it is a very	23
need a lot of	23
to deal with this	23
over the last 10	23
what i learned from	23
they didnt have the	23
was five years old	23
the way that i	23
that when it comes	23
many of us are	23
came up to me	23
both men and women	23
to believe that the	23
of things that are	23
so what is it	23
but there was a	23
more than one billion	23
you look at these	23
such a way that	23
to know that the	23
going to do about	23
to do with all	23
a lot of sense	23
like to talk to	23
is that we cant	23
we have to admit	23
to get to know	23
all the rest of	23
the power of a	23
want to go back	23
we want to build	23
couple of weeks ago	23
this is a story	23
to the beginning of	23
of the human mind	23
want you to notice	23
i told you about	23
and here you see	23
wanted to go to	23
this is where i	23
they want to go	23
it works in the	23
and closer to the	23
and now there are	23
be able to help	23
we have the tools	23
and you see a	23
figure out what the	23
there is no such	23
this is a huge	23
so that i can	23
a whole range of	23
and the thing that	23
turns out that if	23
have to be the	23
much more like a	23
in a straight line	23
the head of a	23
it means you can	23
a way to get	23
give you an idea	23
the bad news is	23
i think its time	23
center of the brain	23
want to know about	23
i want to hear	23
and because of the	23
know that this is	23
i could tell you	23
as soon as you	23
im going to make	23
of neurons in the	23
first time that we	23
it was written by	23
we have to ask	23
see that we have	23
the united states in	23
of all of these	23
i dont give a	23
about the history of	23
interact with each other	23
the core of the	23
now we have to	23
of different types of	23
a lot of this	23
the idea of using	23
the rest of their	23
this is why i	23
us who we are	23
all different kinds of	23
going to be so	23
the rest of it	23
to the extent that	23
but i believe that	23
but i do know	23
so now we can	23
like to talk about	23
can figure out how	23
did not want to	23
youre looking at the	23
to find out what	23
going to do the	23
you can see some	23
on the way to	23
to figure out a	23
to take advantage of	23
a sense of how	23
thats a good thing	23
and now we have	23
how can we do	23
to get people to	23
to take a moment	23
many of us have	23
kinds of things that	23
when you hear the	23
we can talk about	23
over the past six	23
i just showed you	23
can be used to	23
as part of their	23
of the world to	23
access to the internet	23
go around the world	23
it really is a	23
youre thinking about this	23
and of course this	23
over the last 20	23
was supposed to be	23
the age of the	23
more than any other	23
whats interesting is that	23
if you can get	23
dont know if its	23
we wanted to see	23
is not just the	23
tip of the iceberg	23
of the most amazing	23
the relationship between the	23
is the opposite of	23
in the world so	23
way of looking at	23
that we get from	23
not going to have	23
would like to have	23
to be at the	23
on and on and	23
hard for us to	23
i want to suggest	23
if i have to	23
i can show you	23
and ive got to	23
but on the other	23
you can see an	23
now i have to	23
the height of the	23
this is where the	23
what am i going	22
so much so that	22
the idea of a	22
is not a good	22
in the last couple	22
the only people who	22
to give them a	22
put it on a	22
but by the time	22
have in common is	22
we are the most	22
is to have a	22
seems to me that	22
theres not a lot	22
to do two things	22
we all need to	22
see here is a	22
in addition to that	22
go ahead and play	22
of things that we	22
we found out that	22
we dont even know	22
of the extra dimensions	22
i was born and	22
may or may not	22
and what do you	22
in the ground and	22
where do we go	22
order for us to	22
would you say to	22
whats wrong with this	22
weve got to do	22
that in the future	22
what if there were	22
and i knew that	22
that at the end	22
is that we will	22
we do a lot	22
on the front of	22
i dont mean that	22
that we are in	22
what does it do	22
you dont have a	22
you can actually see	22
so what we need	22
and trying to understand	22
but i know that	22
so it was a	22
a question for you	22
in this room who	22
so heres an example	22
have a couple of	22
theres nothing wrong with	22
i wanted to find	22
into the hands of	22
to be a lot	22
because this is not	22
i want to close	22
is something that is	22
that we all have	22
i look forward to	22
turn it into a	22
but what does that	22
been working on this	22
this is that we	22
you know what they	22
she was going to	22
the last 200 years	22
the things that they	22
and so i did	22
i have a friend	22
a lot of new	22
the last three years	22
about it for a	22
this is really important	22
is the number one	22
short period of time	22
the world who are	22
so we want to	22
look at it from	22
of the most beautiful	22
tell you that we	22
the sound of a	22
we find is that	22
it was not a	22
so it seems that	22
you go back to	22
end of the spectrum	22
when i was seven	22
and you might say	22
and on the other	22
and he looked at	22
what we do in	22
and we have an	22
to tell a story	22
dont have to do	22
what makes us human	22
i had to go	22
we found that the	22
the same with a	22
that they dont have	22
to get all the	22
if you can imagine	22
there is such a	22
in the fact that	22
one of my colleagues	22
we know that in	22
that there was something	22
as we go through	22
and we were able	22
what im doing now	22
the cost of the	22
by the time they	22
that there was no	22
people from all over	22
or tens of thousands	22
the last 40 years	22
for the development of	22
to do what they	22
is very close to	22
show you what i	22
so when you look	22
she was one of	22
going to solve the	22
a world where we	22
people in the room	22
two million years ago	22
and what i want	22
the edge of a	22
the way up to	22
with all of the	22
this is a beautiful	22
had to do it	22
see it every day	22
i have to be	22
out how to do	22
have a question for	22
by the fact that	22
in a few hours	22
been able to get	22
when i started to	22
there are many more	22
tells us is that	22
as far as we	22
we dont know why	22
and they had a	22
from the rest of	22
sure some of you	22
were really good at	22
if we go back	22
and if we were	22
so this is how	22
my life it was	22
no way of knowing	22
at the base of	22
on the top of	22
the answer is that	22
i was invited to	22
but it is a	22
and here is the	22
way to do that	22
is not an option	22
it seems like the	22
told me that i	22
were able to do	22
and when i say	22
what i did was	22
to take you on	22
we have to take	22
in a number of	22
a bunch of other	22
what we really want	22
we need to learn	22
and i can see	22
now one of the	22
of all kinds of	22
was going to have	22
hundreds of billions of	22
our own solar system	22
but we have a	22
it back to the	22
figure out if we	22
is that you have	22
are trying to do	22
for the last few	22
be a better way	22
way to do this	22
something wrong with me	22
was a time when	22
one of the only	22
is going to have	22
in order for us	22
in the eyes and	22
not the same as	22
how do we build	22
all of the other	22
know what im saying	22
there are people in	22
and if you do	22
aspect of this is	22
we know that its	22
it wasnt going to	22
do we go from	22
so thats exactly what	22
as well as other	22
you thank you very	22
that this is going	22
and that is a	22
not only does it	22
he said to me	22
the one that i	22
im sure some of	22
means that we have	22
but i think that	22
i wanted to show	22
i cant think of	22
its the same with	22
this was going to	22
want to change the	22
in the city of	22
to work in the	22
all the time i	22
i did is i	22
were going through the	22
see on the screen	22
i want to put	22
the next couple of	22
i think its very	22
from new york to	22
live in a time	22
because there are no	22
the one hand and	22
and i remember thinking	22
to you a little	22
and a half thousand	22
millions of people around	22
and we were very	22
but i have to	22
and i didnt know	22
and we see the	22
it looks like the	22
in front of your	22
in front of this	22
i lived in a	22
on a regular basis	22
you have to trust	22
the rule of law	22
a world war ii	22
the way that they	22
so there was a	22
to show you an	22
fact that we have	22
many of you know	22
learn how to be	22
leave you with one	22
in the old days	22
i dont really know	22
they have a lot	22
of all of our	22
the world in a	22
out how to make	22
let me ask you	22
i went on to	22
we all know this	22
going to talk a	22
a little bit and	22
a long history of	22
the world and they	22
and when we did	22
that it needs to	22
a part of a	22
youre not allowed to	22
the purpose of the	22
want to make it	22
so those are the	22
to do a lot	22
and the united states	22
i went to school	22
the nest maintenance workers	22
if there is a	22
but you get the	22
a way that you	22
we found that we	22
ive come to believe	22
little bit more than	22
affects all of us	22
need to find a	22
about the kinds of	22
just as much as	22
were going to play	22
all of the things	22
and i tried to	22
are part of the	22
at the cost of	22
and let me tell	21
in the area of	21
from time to time	21
but the most important	21
may be able to	21
but there was no	21
the way that the	21
able to do it	21
people who care about	21
the development of the	21
make a ted talk	21
my brother and i	21
big part of the	21
the second is that	21
got a little bit	21
in terms of a	21
in the wake of	21
what we dont know	21
electricity from clean energy	21
can do that with	21
in front of them	21
try to understand the	21
to do things that	21
we ought to be	21
look in the mirror	21
is to figure out	21
i want people to	21
and i know what	21
and so i decided	21
things that we are	21
the role of the	21
share with you some	21
a lot of talk	21
to solve the problem	21
to end with a	21
is going to become	21
to the idea of	21
now we can take	21
such a thing as	21
it might look like	21
going to happen in	21
there are all kinds	21
ive spent the last	21
of new york city	21
talk out of you	21
invite all of you	21
so we came up	21
that was the only	21
a way to do	21
an example of what	21
do the things that	21
at the surface of	21
got a piece of	21
to do with our	21
of a sense of	21
species on the planet	21
a new form of	21
in which we can	21
far as im concerned	21
for most of us	21
in the right direction	21
a role to play	21
lets come back to	21
i used to think	21
and you see this	21
i didnt even know	21
i thought i could	21
we go to the	21
lets look at a	21
it be great if	21
for a period of	21
lets take a closer	21
you a couple of	21
ever want to do	21
with a group of	21
would like to share	21
how many of us	21
in this room and	21
in the world has	21
get away with it	21
end of the century	21
a couple of hours	21
to be kind of	21
in response to drying	21
as far as the	21
i was starting to	21
but most of all	21
of that is that	21
so there is a	21
need to look at	21
think there is a	21
i suddenly realized that	21
first time in the	21
at the time he	21
more than anything else	21
if they want to	21
based on the idea	21
and it can be	21
of the european union	21
as a sort of	21
thats going to change	21
which means that the	21
ive been able to	21
the last time you	21
dollars a year in	21
want to see the	21
rides per day in	21
and you have a	21
where we have the	21
how long it will	21
picture of a bird	21
but what we do	21
going to play a	21
and we had a	21
a state of being	21
of the world we	21
we can do a	21
ted talk out of	21
that which is untouched	21
i went to see	21
i had a little	21
the higgs field is	21
and i ended up	21
like to do is	21
and so i started	21
this is a problem	21
wouldnt it be great	21
a step back and	21
to do that for	21
at the time i	21
know what i mean	21
for this kind of	21
she said to me	21
is going on in	21
goes back to the	21
be able to find	21
from clean energy sources	21
in order to achieve	21
in a clean energy	21
of the higgs field	21
the first thing you	21
anyone in this room	21
in the future and	21
are all kinds of	21
we are living in	21
in the last five	21
in the past few	21
to the point of	21
an infinite number of	21
so we can see	21
came to me and	21
if you could zoom	21
you cant help but	21
and most of all	21
i really believe that	21
do you do that	21
on the left and	21
dont want to get	21
that have to do	21
its important to remember	21
the second thing is	21
but it was really	21
and i dont mean	21
it turns out people	21
doing things that are	21
do you think we	21
this is in the	21
thats the sort of	21
if we go to	21
what we do know	21
to know what the	21
you come back to	21
that you can use	21
whats going to be	21
of the time and	21
and see what happens	21
and then there was	21
the time they were	21
and i think about	21
go back to that	21
and they do this	21
told me that he	21
and i thought about	21
the high school movement	21
i was a child	21
trying to understand what	21
youre trying to do	21
im here today to	21
is a lot more	21
i can get a	21
that are smarter than	21
of the work that	21
in this kind of	21
is that its a	21
if we can do	21
you can think about	21
from all walks of	21
that we can go	21
in terms of efficiency	21
you look at a	21
the united states to	21
theres no such thing	21
what we can see	21
here you see a	21
so many of our	21
one thing in common	21
this is such a	21
there is so much	21
you might be a	21
is based on the	21
like it or not	21
first one is the	21
you and i are	21
now is the time	21
we think it is	21
have to make a	21
i dont understand why	21
60 cents a mile	21
that we can actually	21
in the world can	21
go out into the	21
and he wants to	21
weve been doing is	21
we need to get	21
been doing this for	21
back to the lab	21
see whats going on	21
to do with them	21
were going to come	21
is a really important	21
the basic idea is	21
i was talking to	21
and that was really	21
at one of the	21
they are able to	21
in the world where	21
have to do to	21
going up and down	21
and the other thing	21
we think that this	21
takes a long time	21
whatever it takes to	21
we will continue to	21
not the only one	21
a button and get	21
what is happening in	21
to do with what	21
and then i was	21
a show of hands	21
of the brain stem	21
whats going on with	21
over the world to	21
the next 50 years	21
that seems to be	21
happened in the last	21
youre thinking about that	21
the way this works	21
part of the same	21
if we take a	21
right on top of	21
when you hear somebody	21
the mass of the	21
i couldnt wait to	21
put it on the	21
but heres the problem	21
so how do you	21
about how the brain	21
lot of people think	21
a small part of	21
in the world around	21
idea is that we	21
around the world this	21
from the very beginning	21
well it turns out	21
so lets talk about	21
that doesnt mean that	21
theres got to be	21
because thats the way	21
at any given moment	21
which is why i	21
the way you think	21
the thing that makes	21
so much more than	21
them back to the	21
so let me talk	21
you need to go	21
a very early age	21
level of description where	21
its not that i	21
a lot of attention	21
and on and on	21
many different kinds of	21
single one of these	21
to do it is	21
need to do to	21
but if you take	21
to take a look	21
is the same as	21
so what we found	21
as far as im	21
out into the solar	21
we ended up with	21
live in a very	21
we see in the	21
the same thing as	21
the people in this	21
this is not something	21
our girls to be	21
for all of you	21
when you do that	21
on the roof of	21
is not a part	21
there would be a	21
25 years from now	21
i think if we	21
going to be easy	21
in all sorts of	21
but i wanted to	21
because a lot of	21
when i was young	21
why are there so	21
in a position to	21
that you have a	21
a ted talk out	21
this sort of thing	21
to be willing to	21
like to show you	21
went back to the	21
you could zoom in	21
you go to a	21
but i think this	21
it was a really	21
with all kinds of	21
how it works in	21
this is a real	21
i can assure you	21
part of the physical	21
its the kind of	21
a way that we	21
the second part of	21
and this is our	21
to do something like	21
we are talking about	21
thing in the world	21
whether or not we	21
and so i thought	21
than one percent of	21
i had to take	21
but we know that	21
this is where were	21
a great example of	21
the other thing is	21
of you have heard	21
i thank you for	21
out of the car	21
just look at the	21
is probably the most	21
the magnitude of the	21
in touch with my	21
into the brain and	21
from the university of	21
it was clear that	21
we tried to do	21
five and a half	21
in the room with	21
in a variety of	20
of tasks that we	20
the very thing that	20
kind of like that	20
turned to me and	20
and when they do	20
have to realize that	20
i have come to	20
has been in the	20
the fact that in	20
we think we have	20
a few of these	20
to the international space	20
thats what were going	20
will be humans that	20
its up to us	20
the kind of person	20
it looks that way	20
go to the moon	20
make sure that the	20
and we can make	20
change the world and	20
you hear the word	20
a half years ago	20
because it has a	20
look at the data	20
and the best way	20
i knew that i	20
better than a human	20
from the solar wind	20
that he was going	20
then all of a	20
and they have to	20
was going on in	20
blue balls in a	20
to stay in the	20
you need is an	20
the experience of the	20
sort of like a	20
as we all know	20
and defiant act you	20
this is the second	20
is the most therapeutic	20
is the ability to	20
way that we do	20
you think of it	20
used to think that	20
the reason that i	20
of the world but	20
you can participate in	20
it might have been	20
i knew that even	20
so that it can	20
that the united states	20
a big fan of	20
the ability to change	20
spending a lot of	20
the needle and syringe	20
to the developing world	20
in the united kingdom	20
so as you can	20
to convince you that	20
studies have shown that	20
you think about what	20
and so if we	20
its not as if	20
what i found is	20
we have the best	20
different types of thinking	20
that i didnt have	20
tell you is that	20
back to the surface	20
to new york city	20
and as long as	20
was going to go	20
after a couple of	20
this is the sound	20
where we have to	20
many of you may	20
the last 25 years	20
to know what you	20
is more important than	20
to learn more about	20
this second industrial revolution	20
is that we do	20
heres one of the	20
do we do this	20
over a period of	20
but if you want	20
to look for the	20
i would want to	20
and by and large	20
and i found myself	20
the more i thought	20
that the universe is	20
able to match the	20
over the last two	20
is very important for	20
i do believe that	20
have to be very	20
how does this work	20
in the gulf of	20
we can come up	20
and the whole world	20
all of them are	20
a new way to	20
i hope that you	20
at the height of	20
terms of efficiency or	20
and thats one of	20
little bit more like	20
want to thank you	20
and they want to	20
and youll see that	20
that we might be	20
trying to understand how	20
wanted to find out	20
no matter what the	20
is more likely to	20
lets see if we	20
since world war ii	20
a picture of it	20
so that they could	20
how would you feel	20
i know this is	20
and i sat down	20
the world around them	20
sometimes you have to	20
my team and i	20
it runs on the	20
that we are a	20
of the tasks that	20
to make a living	20
most therapeutic and defiant	20
right now theres a	20
because we are all	20
i think most people	20
turing test for poetry	20
until the end of	20
did the following experiment	20
the more i feel	20
stand in front of	20
to the point that	20
for years and years	20
i was sitting in	20
but we can also	20
if you think poem	20
and the answer to	20
i did the only	20
her she was born	20
the kind of religious	20
runs on the fact	20
goes on and on	20
that is not my	20
and you get this	20
to do this kind	20
the cool thing is	20
we all know the	20
on the first day	20
to wash their hands	20
kind of like the	20
think in terms of	20
come up to me	20
if you do this	20
and the same is	20
a part of our	20
a number of reasons	20
realized that i had	20
most of you are	20
so here we are	20
ill never forget the	20
so when we look	20
all of the time	20
because it looks that	20
is the mother of	20
and my personal favorite	20
the problem was that	20
i also believe that	20
where its used to	20
dont think this is	20
out whats going on	20
in the year we	20
so if you have	20
the very existence of	20
tell her she was	20
lot to do with	20
so one thing that	20
can you tell us	20
where we are now	20
the same thing and	20
what you cant see	20
that is what i	20
to ask questions about	20
in the presence of	20
a very different way	20
your brain has no	20
to predict the future	20
number of years ago	20
i love the way	20
of the reasons i	20
algorithms were able to	20
on the face of	20
all well and good	20
give a damn about	20
learn how to make	20
and i knew i	20
to go to mars	20
theres been a lot	20
and if we could	20
i decided to go	20
not very good at	20
hope for the future	20
going to get it	20
to bring it back	20
is smarter than you	20
fraction of a second	20
had the chance to	20
about other people and	20
of the american dream	20
trying to get to	20
in the front of	20
decided to focus on	20
life is going to	20
and the most important	20
around the world in	20
to write a book	20
when we think of	20
to the world that	20
were able to match	20
and the reason it	20
of how technology is	20
is going to get	20
around the world who	20
70 percent of the	20
when you want to	20
weve got to get	20
a little bit differently	20
of efficiency or productivity	20
most important thing is	20
are people who are	20
who killed bin ladenism	20
i wanted to say	20
out of the sea	20
be humans that are	20
to fall in love	20
because we have a	20
imagine being able to	20
thing im going to	20
jordan 3 black cement	20
they go to the	20
we think of the	20
youre looking at is	20
i was there to	20
to do a little	20
believe that we are	20
and they were all	20
this has been a	20
and what we see	20
the whole of the	20
today im going to	20
and i kind of	20
people who want to	20
theres more in a	20
so we had a	20
tell us what to	20
time in the history	20
the winning algorithms were	20
and at this point	20
you can do is	20
act you can do	20
want to try to	20
look at a few	20
the world wide web	20
at the time that	20
but it means that	20
to have the same	20
have to change the	20
that needs to be	20
you can take a	20
out what to do	20
we need to ask	20
actually one of the	20
what you find is	20
of different kinds of	20
i know what youre	20
defiant act you can	20
have to invest in	20
we end up with	20
of the human race	20
you have to give	20
to give it to	20
balls in a row	20
we are here to	20
in some parts of	20
you can see all	20
the middle east is	20
we know about other	20
part of that is	20
if you get a	20
a lot of questions	20
of the smartest people	20
and allow them to	20
chance to go to	20
people out of poverty	20
they dont know what	20
its going to work	20
we didnt have to	20
things in the world	20
and on the bottom	20
in one of my	20
of the network and	20
the things that humans	20
the most therapeutic and	20
can see that its	20
maybe theres more in	20
of the things they	20
and so these are	20
we can take a	20
the growth of the	20
i wish i had	20
and it was really	20
in the world who	20
be used as a	20
i was in a	20
all of the sudden	20
hour and a half	20
where there are no	20
us a lot about	20
as many people as	20
and put it into	20
we could do that	20
have a bit of	20
its not enough to	20
of men and women	20
i think its really	20
you can see where	20
and so on so	20
the equivalent of a	20
to the conclusion that	20
is the reason why	20
so i think the	20
a lot about what	20
that there is something	20
that we can see	20
if we think about	20
gardening is the most	20
the reason is because	20
its the first time	20
the next thing we	20
you think of your	20
here are some examples	20
us to create a	20
roughly the size of	20
the human immune system	20
because there are more	20
that i was a	20
this means that we	20
to be that way	20
show you how to	20
are many people who	20
shape of the extra	20
the nature of reality	20
we wanted to make	20
the diversity of the	20
neurons in the brain	20
what do you say	20
the roof of the	20
and then i would	20
and no one had	20
three blue balls in	20
the us and the	20
you have all the	20
im going to leave	20
up in the middle	20
are part of a	20
i think i see	20
its not the only	20
winning algorithms were able	20
a function of time	20
thing about this is	20
put it in the	20
is one of those	20
this is the number	20
the problem is the	20
that we can all	20
all of the different	20
we also have a	20
what it takes to	20
going on between the	20
tell her the truth	20
so that was the	20
you a story about	20
that we can connect	20
you see is the	20
have you ever been	20
little bit like a	20
the turn of the	20
i think you have	20
and then i got	20
going to see an	20
do something with it	20
therapeutic and defiant act	20
the next few decades	20
is a place where	20
do you think is	20
kind of religious where	20
it will be humans	20
they need to do	20
it goes back to	20
we did the following	20
looking at the world	20
i want to try	20
for billions of years	20
and its not a	20
united states and the	20
back to the beginning	20
because of the way	20
what i found was	20
of how the brain	20
a world where everything	19
in a totally new	19
not ready for a	19
which means you have	19
million people a year	19
it this is the	19
to spend the rest	19
the atmosphere of mars	19
the real question is	19
thing i wanted to	19
that you can buy	19
on the topic of	19
and a half times	19
i went to my	19
that allows me to	19
this a little bit	19
and try to make	19
going to say that	19
why we have to	19
and thats not true	19
give you two examples	19
we think of as	19
this is how it	19
that we are the	19
the wake of the	19
its the same thing	19
all of us who	19
to reach out and	19
we talk about the	19
for most of my	19
of the most common	19
at the history of	19
many different types of	19
in a fundamental way	19
little bit of an	19
to understand how the	19
that we can change	19
you need to have	19
trying to find a	19
and so we had	19
its a big problem	19
you can figure out	19
need to do a	19
when i was 14	19
dont have to rely	19
this is what happened	19
i got a little	19
me tell you how	19
a totally new way	19
a tiny fraction of	19
to think about that	19
there was a huge	19
of the questions that	19
and i made a	19
you want to find	19
were not talking about	19
i look at this	19
a long period of	19
what is the best	19
are very good at	19
than half of the	19
know that there is	19
and you can actually	19
and thats a real	19
if you do it	19
and this is my	19
the fact that were	19
a lot like the	19
a place in the	19
why dont we just	19
the color of the	19
the ways that we	19
across the arab region	19
and stuff like that	19
on the right side	19
but its going to	19
us what to think	19
and what we need	19
we have the right	19
was a part of	19
youre seeing on the	19
to the center of	19
i feel like a	19
i will show you	19
i could see the	19
a part of their	19
that at the same	19
we have to start	19
and it was this	19
as long as i	19
going to give this	19
most of us have	19
to do what i	19
that are part of	19
know theyre going to	19
i told you that	19
have to use a	19
can do with this	19
not the kind of	19
dont even want to	19
to give you the	19
all over the internet	19
can lead to a	19
because theyre going to	19
less likely to be	19
thats the reason why	19
the very nature of	19
to do was to	19
all of us here	19
in front of it	19
you see is that	19
that if you have	19
we have access to	19
no matter how many	19
that we wanted to	19
to meet that demand	19
was having an affair	19
least we can do	19
as part of a	19
talking about something that	19
really wanted to do	19
very close to the	19
and i learned that	19
to the concept of	19
does that mean that	19
rules of the game	19
felt like i was	19
we can make it	19
how many times have	19
to do it the	19
the fact that a	19
of you are probably	19
they have access to	19
reason for this is	19
to read and write	19
a lot of what	19
just want you to	19
the brain and the	19
what youre seeing is	19
up to the surface	19
all going to be	19
it doesnt matter how	19
dont give a damn	19
to start with a	19
that that would be	19
have to take a	19
went down to the	19
a half a million	19
like you and me	19
know if you can	19
up to the top	19
and i was there	19
the genes that are	19
the ceo of a	19
to create the conditions	19
we dont work with	19
about the difference between	19
out of the ground	19
is the future of	19
be able to learn	19
knew i had to	19
that turns out to	19
we do know is	19
is that even though	19
it was a big	19
on a scale of	19
might have been a	19
whatever you call it	19
few years ago i	19
and when that happens	19
what youre looking for	19
the same thing happens	19
i do is i	19
it comes down to	19
when things go wrong	19
a closer look at	19
a huge impact on	19
were going to keep	19
now you have to	19
is more than just	19
come to understand that	19
it should have been	19
they can do it	19
to go down to	19
that makes us human	19
to do it we	19
the sort of thing	19
i think thats the	19
what you would do	19
and weve had to	19
based on the fact	19
think its going to	19
years at a time	19
that some of these	19
connect with each other	19
care so much about	19
need to have the	19
the ones who have	19
and i saw this	19
in the modern world	19
long it will take	19
a list of all	19
in science and engineering	19
that it can be	19
but also in the	19
would happen if we	19
ill tell you about	19
world in which we	19
not the same thing	19
get rid of it	19
would you want to	19
and the ability to	19
youre going to find	19
a few things that	19
things that are going	19
i put on my	19
were trying to understand	19
under the control of	19
the function of the	19
to give us a	19
as i said before	19
the least we can	19
and they are also	19
and i was a	19
that i was the	19
we take a look	19
and it could be	19
is where it gets	19
if you do that	19
do we have a	19
was 14 years old	19
i invite all of	19
where i come from	19
there was a very	19
a wide range of	19
do know is that	19
the ones with the	19
the fall of the	19
its a big deal	19
there was something really	19
to where we are	19
had no idea that	19
we need to work	19
i went down to	19
you in this room	19
of those things that	19
if you take the	19
here are a couple	19
see how we can	19
dont know if youve	19
to do with that	19
thing that i think	19
and the people who	19
to see in the	19
somewhere along the line	19
to reach out to	19
you have to see	19
in the spring of	19
in the near future	19
which brings me to	19
and if youre not	19
i wanted to try	19
i was at a	19
of the big bang	19
and there will be	19
that we look at	19
have the tools to	19
i tell you the	19
if we could get	19
not only do you	19
these are the kinds	19
all of you are	19
let me introduce you	19
and i think one	19
what do you mean	19
is what happens to	19
like to take you	19
we started to look	19
to talk to me	19
to me when i	19
to realize that the	19
the first time a	19
as long as they	19
of the human genome	19
interacting with each other	19
to do something else	19
but the problem with	19
and what id like	19
you think that the	19
these sorts of things	19
come back to this	19
every one of these	19
would go to the	19
000 years ago and	19
going to be more	19
ended up in the	19
just going to be	19
when i was at	19
a world where the	19
think it would be	19
the one thing that	19
if you have to	19
im most excited about	19
to the next one	19
is there a way	19
so this means that	19
way for me to	19
no one had ever	19
imagine if we could	19
born and raised in	19
and out of the	19
in my lab is	19
youre anything like me	19
one side of the	19
we think about it	19
there are tons of	19
of what its like	19
this is a project	19
the architecture of the	19
is not what it	19
and it was an	19
the way it is	19
that i had done	19
answer to that question	19
most of us were	19
a new generation of	19
but thats not going	19
is very similar to	19
and the same thing	19
here in front of	19
are much more likely	19
the ways in which	19
last but not least	19
at the risk of	19
im not sure what	19
like the united states	19
and thats why the	19
you dont have the	19
got to do it	19
means to be a	19
a really important thing	19
you have to put	19
and thats what weve	19
that youre looking at	19
one of the interesting	19
if youre not a	19
how it works its	19
the answer to the	19
in terms of our	19
do you know where	19
you want to look	19
if you look up	19
some of you in	19
the way that were	19
you have to ask	19
the wall street journal	19
the story of how	19
the other things that	19
it was like to	19
the last thing i	19
museum of modern art	19
one of my heroes	19
the way we do	19
we can use the	19
the ones that are	19
the interesting thing is	19
the ones that have	19
the neurons in the	19
so im just going	19
the size of that	19
we have to build	19
up with the idea	19
a million times faster	19
other people in the	19
of the food chain	19
and you can go	19
it would have to	19
for the last year	19
some of the greatest	19
path of least resistance	19
there are risks to	19
the size of your	19
to teach them to	19
to the amount of	19
you have to really	19
at an early age	19
not going to work	19
of the ways we	19
this is how you	19
started to look at	19
its like to be	19
not just talking about	19
on the front lines	19
one part of the	19
the work of the	19
we used to have	19
weve got to make	19
so what were trying	19
time in human history	19
and so thats what	19
the names of the	19
version of the story	19
this is the last	19
that if you are	19
two percent of the	19
know how to make	19
about how were going	19
with a little bit	19
but in the last	19
how difficult it is	19
and the second is	19
and thats when i	19
that all of these	19
im a little bit	19
the first thing they	19
one of us is	19
create the conditions to	19
the back of your	19
do you think it	19
and in the last	19
give you a few	19
i know that if	19
it will be the	19
and we hope that	19
them in the same	19
believe that we can	19
because we have to	19
me introduce you to	19
we were in the	19
and its a real	19
of us who live	19
in most of the	19
it was the end	19
that it was just	19
i think that there	19
a different way of	19
that brings me to	19
of the brain is	19
and the only thing	19
the most amazing thing	19
if youre anything like	19
is what i call	19
you had to go	19
of the future and	19
i want to thank	19
and we can get	19
now you can see	18
you all know that	18
more and more and	18
a matter of information	18
get the job done	18
we also know that	18
and if we are	18
to do that in	18
and then when i	18
and see how the	18
i dont have time	18
it would be like	18
there was only one	18
to be the most	18
i dont know where	18
the new york city	18
higher risk of depression	18
lets have a look	18
was part of the	18
about a million times	18
to be interested in	18
going to go back	18
the map of the	18
where this is going	18
able to tell the	18
the start of the	18
you look in the	18
it is estimated that	18
and the way it	18
in the 18th century	18
you see in this	18
because i have a	18
of their genetic information	18
became one of the	18
look at all the	18
about 25 percent of	18
see is that the	18
is we need to	18
and because of this	18
what did they do	18
has been able to	18
to leave the european	18
and so you can	18
we continue to improve	18
machines that are smarter	18
and they look at	18
that is not the	18
we will build machines	18
on the ted stage	18
to actually look at	18
want to buy a	18
do you want me	18
what you may not	18
going to get out	18
of the cold war	18
i was just thinking	18
that there will be	18
now take a moment	18
an important part of	18
what they need to	18
to take you back	18
so what if we	18
and we admit that	18
we need to encourage	18
of the way of	18
who has ever lived	18
so a couple of	18
to talk today about	18
would love to have	18
theres a couple of	18
what we do with	18
if we are to	18
tell if im lying	18
other people and about	18
in much of the	18
the rest of our	18
know about other people	18
the population of the	18
to each other in	18
if we really want	18
an example of how	18
trying to create a	18
and then i started	18
in our society in	18
in the early 2000s	18
if thats the case	18
see some of the	18
i think we are	18
we could do a	18
is what makes our	18
in my entire life	18
in the right place	18
where i grew up	18
world where everything is	18
would like to think	18
thats what it looks	18
we live in today	18
talking about the end	18
you want to buy	18
if that is true	18
out in front of	18
youre going to go	18
else in the world	18
so let me explain	18
come home from work	18
a really long time	18
the time that i	18
where you want to	18
this brings me to	18
a few of my	18
it has a very	18
it can be the	18
a lot of problems	18
these are the people	18
in parts of the	18
labor is a way	18
thousands of times per	18
know what i was	18
that this was a	18
an appropriate emotional response	18
can see here is	18
the nervous system of	18
thats the equivalent of	18
is not a single	18
i quit my job	18
the world to see	18
percent of their genetic	18
at a level of	18
the united states for	18
are basically the same	18
for a little while	18
end of this year	18
to twitter with the	18
that are trying to	18
what happened to the	18
in the heart of	18
want to close with	18
how should we live	18
up a little bit	18
when i first started	18
to do today is	18
a new set of	18
that if you want	18
freedom of the press	18
about the age of	18
told not to worry	18
you cant do it	18
to look at it	18
to return to the	18
want to build a	18
and it has been	18
li la la la	18
go and look at	18
he said he was	18
for all kinds of	18
in a certain sense	18
intelligence into our machines	18
save a lot of	18
but the fact that	18
i want to bring	18
how should we work	18
that can be done	18
a few years back	18
there might be some	18
idea how long it	18
how do you make	18
to do that safely	18
and every time i	18
to start thinking about	18
dont know how many	18
us to create the	18
you can also do	18
how do we fix	18
that you can go	18
i got my first	18
and so i want	18
going to take us	18
of it as an	18
that in the next	18
and i saw that	18
and the key thing	18
going back and forth	18
york to long beach	18
and part of the	18
it and if you	18
we now have the	18
of the world in	18
then you have the	18
and you need to	18
we had to start	18
in the last three	18
in the world it	18
your hand if youve	18
of the founders of	18
may not be able	18
in the last 50	18
work all the time	18
a different way and	18
whether or not you	18
i think i would	18
about investing in the	18
let me just give	18
and as youll see	18
be able to impact	18
in the community and	18
is exactly the same	18
the white picket fence	18
you dont like the	18
can make the world	18
all i had to	18
im saying is that	18
of what we can	18
it takes a lot	18
thank you for the	18
all of that is	18
one of my students	18
spend so much time	18
at me and she	18
just like you would	18
that you dont have	18
to say that this	18
my sister and i	18
in the us alone	18
going around the world	18
is something that i	18
have you forgotten your	18
do i think i	18
to a group of	18
about a year ago	18
to what we call	18
a new era of	18
conditions to do that	18
going to take to	18
to play video games	18
can we do that	18
in this country and	18
try to get a	18
learned a lot of	18
do we get people	18
the amount of time	18
want to take you	18
the best in the	18
the ability to learn	18
i would go to	18
the degree to which	18
what we really need	18
i know how to	18
at a number of	18
the machine that can	18
in order to create	18
to show you next	18
and we can actually	18
were also going to	18
them around the world	18
on the outside of	18
in the beginning of	18
order to be able	18
to the way that	18
the rest of this	18
the medicines patent pool	18
of the last century	18
and i hope to	18
architect of global trade	18
you really have to	18
so what weve been	18
you going to do	18
is it that the	18
i do want to	18
the space of all	18
machine intelligence is here	18
somewhere along the way	18
theres only a few	18
he tell if im	18
and its not because	18
in response to the	18
are smarter than we	18
standing in the middle	18
the conditions to do	18
that are out there	18
have been doing this	18
what theyre doing is	18
in the next 20	18
only prudent path forward	18
refuse to fear failure	18
what kind of world	18
if we just had	18
no idea how long	18
they need to know	18
on the island of	18
but thats not the	18
it was too late	18
that its possible to	18
is a part of	18
access to good nutrition	18
we need to talk	18
do you think you	18
so you can go	18
my goal is to	18
when i looked at	18
because we dont have	18
and looked at the	18
means that we can	18
oil is used to	18
i believe we are	18
for a world war	18
for all to see	18
the way that you	18
we get people to	18
we spend so much	18
if i look at	18
to the sound of	18
youre looking at a	18
one laptop per child	18
a lot to learn	18
along for the ride	18
the only way you	18
as a series of	18
to improve our intelligent	18
it was the same	18
the biggest danger is	18
is just trying to	18
the man on the	18
this would be a	18
a way that was	18
did not have the	18
as we think about	18
guardians of the galaxy	18
figure out what was	18
you forgotten your name	18
will enable us to	18
and do you know	18
a moment to consider	18
is going on here	18
out of all the	18
you might be wondering	18
to love each other	18
in terms of its	18
would allow us to	18
one of our most	18
to be doing things	18
i can do this	18
about three or four	18
the right to work	18
and there would be	18
what would it be	18
and think about it	18
they dont have a	18
how hard it is	18
pigs noses and mouths	18
in the age of	18
so i was thinking	18
you want to change	18
of how we can	18
people in the us	18
so we started thinking	18
for the next few	18
is going to do	18
to have a very	18
and only prudent path	18
tell if youre lying	18
be the kind of	18
that every one of	18
and he was like	18
it is in the	18
and what about the	18
in the power of	18
since the end of	18
this is a plant	18
to believe that we	18
all the way from	18
twitter with the hashtag	18
and ive come to	18
the office of the	18
and so you have	18
nothing more than a	18
going to start with	18
do you have to	18
whats in your hand	18
course of human history	18
kilometers away from the	18
the average age of	18
show you a few	18
have a kind of	18
it will not be	18
make the world more	18
were going to launch	18
we need to create	18
if they wanted to	18
thing to know about	18
the spectrum of intelligence	18
i spend a lot	18
when it came to	18
to you about the	18
there is a difference	18
and for those of	18
held on when i	18
to work on this	18
this was not a	18
is not a lot	18
the numbers on the	18
40 percent of all	18
got to tell you	18
appropriate emotional response to	18
is to look at	18
look at how we	18
is the end of	18
some of the great	18
smarter than we are	18
this machine would be	18
im talking about is	18
stood in for all	18
the introduction of the	18
much to do with	18
so as youre thinking	18
possible for us to	18
to ask you a	18
they have to be	18
im talking about the	18
way back to the	18
out in the open	18
can he tell if	18
have access to good	18
the walt disney company	18
millions of tons of	18
but ill tell you	18
to be really hard	18
in ways that dont	18
in the world right	18
its easy to see	18
you can hear the	18
not to worry is	18
in a way i	18
you ever forgotten your	18
is used to manufacture	18
even if you have	18
me just give you	18
wanted to buy her	18
you get a little	18
take a long time	18
to make it more	18
a way of knowing	18
not only going to	18
back in the 1970s	18
what are we doing	18
what i was looking	18
and what are the	18
the safest and only	18
people and about the	18
we can still be	18
in the last 20	18
you have to imagine	18
make sense of the	18
going to take the	18
tell the story of	18
and then in the	18
this is a lot	18
to do is take	18
to do the best	18
of you may be	18
a hole in the	18
to what we have	18
an idea of how	18
and im trying to	18
know is that the	18
aboard the international space	18
can do this with	18
in the animal kingdom	18
reason were told not	18
leave the european union	18
apart from each other	18
center of the universe	18
more than 30 years	18
you can do with	18
i wanted to tell	18
is part of a	18
seems to be the	18
to get us to	18
thing is that the	18
so is better off	18
it can be done	18
have been trying to	18
from all around the	18
turns out that we	18
is one of our	18
i wrote a letter	18
about the rest of	18
and i got to	18
we didnt have any	18
there are very few	18
that make us up	18
the bottom of that	18
a high risk of	18
gave rise to the	18
this is how long	18
and as i said	18
the same time and	18
we see it in	18
heres a recording of	18
do you say to	18
in the light of	18
the first time you	18
a look at it	18
i want to end	18
thousands of years ago	18
part of a larger	18
outer surface of the	18
that we cant imagine	18
to work on the	18
i had to get	18
in the digital age	18
a guest on airbnb	18
to do that we	18
are lots of things	18
million times faster than	18
in a very simple	18
i should tell you	18
to buy her a	18
will continue to improve	18
to do it in	18
a video of the	18
come back to that	18
new york to long	18
and then i went	18
each other in a	18
these supercharged carbon recyclers	18
knew that even the	18
and this one is	18
and i would say	18
know a lot about	18
and the key to	18
think it is normal	18
the sorts of things	18
it seems likely that	18
take us to create	18
moves through the plant	18
and it becomes a	18
is more of a	18
see the world in	18
thing you have to	18
the ability to make	18
to put them in	18
of course this is	18
fair to say that	18
and about the world	18
think about the future	18
from the beginning of	18
improve our intelligent machines	18
on the part of	18
and she told me	18
we had to deal	18
we used to think	18
what do they do	18
do not need to	18
the concept of introspection	18
and just like the	18
outsource our responsibilities to	18
and then we get	18
i went up to	18
think i see next	18
some of the biggest	18
will take us to	18
answers to these questions	18
for many of you	18
hand side of the	18
have all kinds of	18
i held on when	18
out what was going	18
how do we go	18
and there have been	18
and in many ways	18
we should all be	18
we all live in	18
and ill tell you	18
matter of information processing	18
it was kind of	18
should you be shown	18
a lot of food	18
change the cells in	18
were told not to	18
i am not saying	18
safest and only prudent	18
we do what we	18
my voice in my	18
predict the likelihood of	18
in its own right	18
but i dont know	18
and when you think	18
this type of technology	18
so this robot is	18
to find out that	18
she is strong and	18
made it to the	18
make a difference in	18
i just know that	18
did not know how	18
with the fact that	18
will build machines that	18
on earth is going	18
we are on the	18
by the time theyre	18
and when you do	18
back and forth and	18
its probably going to	18
make sure that people	18
so we know that	18
is the source of	18
did the only thing	18
i found is that	18
a white picket fence	18
and how it works	18
000 dollars a year	18
a part of this	18
when i was about	18
no doubt about it	18
its going to happen	18
it is true that	18
to trust the idea	18
the architect of global	18
dont know the answer	18
down to where i	18
he was talking about	18
and i tell you	18
to figure it out	18
something a little bit	18
you need to get	18
we want to live	18
of us are doing	18
to do if you	18
im going to now	17
to you and i	17
and if you take	17
to you is that	17
find it difficult to	17
one thing that you	17
the world around you	17
at the intersection of	17
me a lot of	17
theres just not enough	17
can look at that	17
live in the world	17
four percent of the	17
world that we live	17
and i could have	17
is a very powerful	17
decided to write about	17
going to open up	17
so we went to	17
of the universe is	17
and he has to	17
us to do that	17
and what we did	17
is a sort of	17
its important that we	17
had to figure out	17
to tell them that	17
the only way that	17
if we can actually	17
get to see the	17
to participate in the	17
when you see this	17
the museum of modern	17
one of us has	17
thats what we need	17
to put it in	17
extra dimensions of space	17
you look at them	17
enough to get us	17
of the future of	17
during the course of	17
our understanding of the	17
you very much indeed	17
if you havent noticed	17
some sort of a	17
that im talking about	17
to do whatever it	17
all of us together	17
all of this data	17
were going to continue	17
they were looking for	17
of them are going	17
i come from a	17
to do that and	17
i was blown away	17
and over the last	17
in the late 1980s	17
lucky enough to be	17
and we can ask	17
to play a game	17
this is the end	17
we do it in	17
to have a little	17
that i am the	17
in the next year	17
want you to remember	17
and they are not	17
and you can think	17
in less than 10	17
company in the world	17
think of that as	17
but its kind of	17
to worry about the	17
have the potential to	17
between men and women	17
i have never been	17
a bunch of people	17
in the direction of	17
you see a lot	17
going to use a	17
going to give them	17
it takes a long	17
the mit media lab	17
then i realized that	17
are a bunch of	17
ive got to tell	17
of what we call	17
had a little lamb	17
that they will be	17
kind of like this	17
depending on how you	17
put it this way	17
i dont know the	17
i was the first	17
they are trying to	17
the job of the	17
is just one of	17
changed the way we	17
you happen to be	17
to you about today	17
just in the last	17
over the last century	17
free and open internet	17
in the next decade	17
is by far the	17
this is my favorite	17
what if there was	17
so if we look	17
us a sense of	17
not have access to	17
this is a pretty	17
in order to study	17
there are things we	17
and he said that	17
this thing called the	17
to think that the	17
the quality of life	17
the next step is	17
thats what we have	17
a number of people	17
we give them a	17
to tell you two	17
means that we are	17
its really important to	17
look at things like	17
it would look like	17
heres a picture of	17
and thats how it	17
this is sort of	17
because if you dont	17
so we dont have	17
to do this in	17
and after a few	17
a good thing to	17
flipped on its head	17
to look at is	17
at the time and	17
you live in a	17
we had to get	17
dont have a solution	17
and he would say	17
and then of course	17
is much more than	17
that we could use	17
a number of different	17
im not good at	17
even though it can	17
come out of a	17
so for the last	17
we asked people to	17
a matter of hours	17
there will be more	17
because i dont want	17
didnt know how to	17
to spend more time	17
we can do better	17
after year after year	17
wants to know what	17
that you had to	17
material is going to	17
where they came from	17
things at the same	17
need to make sure	17
of what it means	17
up on the screen	17
about whats going on	17
what happened in the	17
thats the good news	17
of those things are	17
so you can have	17
or whatever it is	17
so the way we	17
mary had a little	17
need to change the	17
and then theres the	17
the course of human	17
the last of the	17
we try to do	17
do we have any	17
years in prison for	17
thats part of the	17
has the ability to	17
and that will be	17
me a little bit	17
you didnt even know	17
but we do know	17
wanted to do something	17
i want to speak	17
the national academy of	17
and its a beautiful	17
and use it to	17
we dont have time	17
but because of the	17
in a place that	17
and we asked them	17
you want to take	17
a couple of other	17
part of the process	17
out the best in	17
not only do we	17
be the one to	17
but if you can	17
so lets start with	17
the future of food	17
and then he said	17
to go in and	17
so i think were	17
those are the things	17
way for us to	17
it has a little	17
until you realize that	17
can change the cells	17
we just have to	17
needs to be done	17
want to see it	17
really want to know	17
part of this is	17
i think they should	17
to take on the	17
the end of their	17
when i tell them	17
i look at that	17
and look at this	17
are going to change	17
me be very clear	17
would you ever want	17
to do right now	17
i was five years	17
do what they do	17
can we do something	17
you can see them	17
out on a date	17
to them in the	17
it changes the way	17
on the planet and	17
right down to the	17
that we will have	17
outside of our solar	17
and that is how	17
for everyone to see	17
what we know is	17
i can think of	17
i know some of	17
but what i want	17
in a long time	17
that now we can	17
there are going to	17
but were not going	17
and thats really important	17
the united states today	17
after a few months	17
how you do it	17
we think this is	17
billions of dollars in	17
also a little bit	17
tell you the story	17
the us government has	17
and you look at	17
id like to make	17
would never do this	17
connected to the internet	17
but what we really	17
but you dont have	17
step back and ask	17
to look back at	17
i came to realize	17
i think that as	17
we dont know about	17
and everything in between	17
the same size as	17
there are at least	17
so you dont have	17
its going to land	17
a hell of a	17
to ask a question	17
we are working on	17
the name of a	17
and it doesnt really	17
what theyre doing and	17
in the world they	17
i have a little	17
is that we dont	17
can be a part	17
if i tell you	17
doing is trying to	17
what should i do	17
we know a lot	17
the place where you	17
bad news is that	17
be really hard to	17
the front lines of	17
be able to go	17
talk a lot about	17
we have to remember	17
but im not going	17
at a couple of	17
have to be really	17
wanted to make it	17
what is the next	17
the person who is	17
that at the time	17
as a human being	17
where a lot of	17
we are not just	17
so lets think about	17
the united states but	17
the internet of things	17
and we started to	17
to me is that	17
for the next 10	17
at this point in	17
my hope is that	17
and i still have	17
a bit of an	17
the problem with this	17
at four oclock in	17
do you remember the	17
people who dont have	17
to do anything we	17
we can see this	17
it really does is	17
the first was that	17
on the streets of	17
museum of natural history	17
live in an age	17
and this is exactly	17
to try and get	17
in the same time	17
a country that is	17
turns out that there	17
made me want to	17
to answer this question	17
six and a half	17
we killed every single	17
i didnt have a	17
most of us do	17
that is why i	17
much greater than the	17
would want to be	17
what would happen to	17
when we got to	17
the leader of the	17
every single day and	17
how we feel about	17
of millions of years	17
planets outside of our	17
if you go back	17
so why do we	17
is its going to	17
on the right track	17
all the way through	17
in both of these	17
i think that in	17
lets look at this	17
and its not that	17
it took a lot	17
to remind you of	17
that i had a	17
that we can take	17
in order to accomplish	17
effects of climate change	17
to do here is	17
all kinds of other	17
fact that you can	17
in order not to	17
let me be very	17
and in a world	17
a whole new world	17
thats a little bit	17
of the way the	17
and in a minute	17
answer to the question	17
to go a little	17
of the end of	17
dont want to know	17
that im working on	17
and if we do	17
as i was saying	17
the first one to	17
my husband and i	17
early in my career	17
the code of life	17
how the brain deals	17
seven days a week	17
its not just that	17
not the other way	17
the second reason is	17
when i hear that	17
thing that we can	17
and so we need	17
it was a little	17
going to do now	17
the human body and	17
to the problem of	17
think we have a	17
have to recognize that	17
take it for granted	17
so its not just	17
to look at what	17
one of the two	17
they were in the	17
so much of what	17
and then i realized	17
what happens if we	17
and you can find	17
most of you have	17
to give it a	17
an hour and a	17
very different from the	17
pay attention to the	17
we go back to	17
you might like to	17
thing to do is	17
no longer have to	17
the brain deals with	17
did i want to	17
the first step to	17
we know that we	17
to be a part	17
what it really does	17
in real time and	17
them are going to	17
theyre trying to get	17
a tiny bit of	17
to be sure that	17
the diameter of a	17
there in the world	17
is he going to	17
to see how they	17
think the answer is	17
to decide whether to	17
so im not going	17
a study done in	17
know that we can	17
to be comfortable with	17
its sort of a	17
for the last decade	17
how does it feel	17
this is really a	17
where youre going to	17
the funny thing is	17
you a lot of	17
leave you with this	17
if you care about	17
from point a to	17
hes one of the	17
i learned how to	17
to get back to	17
to see how we	17
seen a lot of	17
a solution to this	17
i cant wait to	17
so where does this	17
but for all of	17
were all the same	17
the countries that are	17
on the border of	17
that they could be	17
right here in the	17
and they told me	17
that i was not	17
so we look at	17
the same goes for	17
been doing it for	17
to spend a lot	17
that there are other	17
for us to take	17
year after year after	17
may not have been	17
but there was one	17
and then i go	17
that we know about	17
to step back and	17
for the same reason	17
going to solve this	17
to use a lot	17
an order of magnitude	17
a free and open	17
on a personal level	17
you ever want to	17
and it doesnt mean	17
but there are also	17
that it is not	17
to me this is	17
would want to do	17
to the future of	17
i think that thats	17
a to point b	17
a good time to	17
years of doing this	17
i have to ask	17
i want it to	17
to show them that	17
know that they are	17
i want to focus	17
start working on the	17
we learned a lot	17
point a to point	17
and what we can	17
have to find a	17
that we can have	17
was going to get	17
is that the technology	17
there are things that	17
the whole point of	17
i mean by that	17
that this is an	17
there must be some	17
youre talking about something	17
things that we can	17
in the long term	17
to tell the difference	17
but there are things	17
youll see that the	17
that you and i	17
youre part of the	17
id like to take	17
in the new yorker	17
to do that so	17
and we live in	17
what we could do	17
the idea was that	17
the same time so	17
got an email from	17
i want to introduce	17
the result of that	17
there are times when	17
do we need to	17
can also look at	17
we didnt have a	17
can we do about	17
have a way of	17
we might want to	17
i would not have	17
so thank you very	17
a huge part of	17
we are not going	17
i ask you to	17
never seen anything like	17
do we know that	17
if you want a	17
half of the worlds	17
and thats a really	17
i dont just mean	17
give you one example	17
the end of your	17
all we have to	17
to do this we	17
but in the middle	17
and i told him	17
in the vicinity of	17
have to make sure	17
the face of a	17
is no longer a	17
from flower to flower	17
to be in that	17
we think that we	17
to take a step	17
and all you need	17
a story about a	17
this is the story	17
than any other country	17
youre more likely to	17
though it can be	17
of what we consider	17
to show you today	17
so this kind of	17
so i went back	17
from the inside out	17
what they found was	17
is that people are	17
i could do it	17
we didnt know about	17
so that by the	17
there are billions of	17
small group of people	17
we know there are	17
thousands of miles away	17
a point where we	17
if i was a	17
to stand up and	17
when they try to	17
but there is one	17
this is not my	17
make sure that this	17
they told me that	17
do you believe that	17
we can connect with	17
going to want to	17
the top of their	17
the world trade organization	17
tell you what it	17
rest of their lives	17
the destruction of the	17
and ill give you	17
realized that i was	17
we were very excited	17
so what youre seeing	17
and so we can	17
were beginning to get	17
a part of my	17
we all know what	17
of the planet and	17
that i would like	17
you want to put	17
to all of you	17
that we take for	17
about how you can	17
the life of the	17
now you have a	17
have anything to do	17
and in so doing	17
try to make the	16
a leap of faith	16
that you can imagine	16
in my lab in	16
in about five years	16
at it from the	16
the bhutan for life	16
the world and this	16
wanted to talk about	16
in the past 10	16
tries to maximize future	16
so we at the	16
to evolve human beings	16
wanted to know how	16
be less of a	16
at home in the	16
we dont have enough	16
show it to you	16
100 percent of the	16
the way we have	16
and make sense of	16
in the same boat	16
have the chance to	16
place in the universe	16
to stand up for	16
or we can change	16
the united states we	16
is broadly applicable to	16
they go into the	16
to be the one	16
they wanted to do	16
thanks very much for	16
parts of the country	16
when you see the	16
the people who want	16
making type i collagen	16
going to put this	16
been working on for	16
anything you want to	16
and i was going	16
have an opportunity to	16
just a few days	16
state of the art	16
thing about it is	16
how to read and	16
he wanted to be	16
need to change our	16
happens to be the	16
come up with some	16
things you can do	16
you do not have	16
we see that entropica	16
to use digital money	16
were not in a	16
when i realized that	16
which is a great	16
would that change about	16
where do you come	16
a deep learning algorithm	16
to fight against the	16
nothing to worry about	16
descendants to help them	16
i didnt know that	16
give us a sense	16
evolve the human body	16
that a few years	16
there is only time	16
need to do in	16
this was one of	16
list of all of	16
are a carbon neutral	16
going to make them	16
most of the world	16
dont think so i	16
can you help me	16
but if you do	16
maybe the ultimate prosthetic	16
fallen in love with	16
going to see is	16
want to enhance a	16
a life two civilization	16
so ive talked about	16
there will be no	16
and all of those	16
this is a small	16
is it ethical to	16
you can go on	16
easier said than done	16
first time in a	16
were talking about it	16
and all of that	16
when i was 18	16
the stuff that we	16
thats not what we	16
it took me a	16
feel like i have	16
to happen in the	16
and each of those	16
my point of view	16
it anywhere in the	16
that had never been	16
theyre really good at	16
cryptocurrencies are the first	16
all over the planet	16
range of acceptable behavior	16
was born and raised	16
and we decided to	16
so i tried to	16
solution to this problem	16
here in new york	16
let me try to	16
so i have a	16
a lot of mistakes	16
if we have a	16
its a good idea	16
die drop it on	16
the amount of money	16
but the good news	16
record the voices of	16
the amount of energy	16
no longer just about	16
that is able to	16
i started looking for	16
youve got to get	16
i can give you	16
that there are two	16
do they love us	16
neutral for all time	16
of the countries that	16
not a people person	16
the side of a	16
how we exchange value	16
when does it achieve	16
at the hebrew university	16
a different set of	16
many of you here	16
going to end up	16
in the us in	16
each other when theyre	16
is under forest cover	16
way down to the	16
they know who their	16
we would love to	16
that were looking at	16
youre an alien race	16
this would be the	16
thanks to the diversity	16
by their own governments	16
beginning of the end	16
how many people are	16
a carbon neutral country	16
believe that they were	16
the outside of the	16
that by the end	16
are the first step	16
im sure everybody would	16
of these different threads	16
how do we turn	16
of the great recession	16
wake up to this	16
people in the audience	16
you have to change	16
of the story that	16
machine that can do	16
at this point is	16
we would have no	16
been able to make	16
sure everybody would like	16
about the need for	16
the world that are	16
so this is one	16
i think were going	16
in our ability to	16
i also think its	16
to do all the	16
the health of our	16
a long time i	16
do every single day	16
up off the ground	16
to deal with these	16
we are right now	16
need to worry about	16
of how we are	16
percent of the american	16
and that is not	16
it getting too much	16
a minute youll see	16
emotions to other species	16
we need to realize	16
not to say that	16
which is probably the	16
you would want to	16
if you start with	16
object you see behind	16
and why is that	16
changed the chemistry of	16
which is that the	16
i know what i	16
i tell you this	16
to go for a	16
what goes on in	16
and on the main	16
becomes a moral imperative	16
you can see these	16
and there are no	16
there might be a	16
not the first time	16
so a few years	16
the rest of his	16
of time thinking about	16
first thing that you	16
just in time to	16
solve all our problems	16
to take you to	16
what might be happening	16
of a community of	16
to me to be	16
know that i am	16
and you try to	16
the world is not	16
show you a little	16
you put them in	16
were not trying to	16
get better and better	16
is given to us	16
i can build a	16
to put together a	16
are the only animals	16
it turns out they	16
how the brain works	16
and see what we	16
such as we have	16
it reminds us that	16
friend and artist in	16
our last quick experiment	16
a plant profile and	16
is the solution to	16
in a time where	16
in order to have	16
not going to happen	16
idea i want to	16
up and down the	16
makes sense to be	16
by that i mean	16
thoughts and emotions to	16
the middle of it	16
a stone or a	16
random sequences of instructions	16
but it was the	16
thats how it looked	16
now at this point	16
rise to the first	16
ability to seek goals	16
know that much about	16
hear a lot about	16
a lot of those	16
has a sense of	16
is that part of	16
that i was being	16
but the fact is	16
right before your eyes	16
are immune to all	16
with a friend of	16
the equal rights amendment	16
it will be a	16
go ahead and grab	16
that led me to	16
he didnt want to	16
is made out of	16
of the first people	16
over the next five	16
i wasnt supposed to	16
a little bit on	16
i think that this	16
we often face is	16
in a new way	16
but one thing i	16
the best part of	16
do you come from	16
all the time its	16
i should say that	16
because we were able	16
are they know who	16
theyre going to take	16
be the same as	16
leave you with a	16
and to be able	16
but it could also	16
what we found out	16
killed every single wolf	16
that the other side	16
be doing things that	16
every country in the	16
we knew it was	16
really going to be	16
so now we have	16
to do with human	16
that i told you	16
the world in which	16
it doesnt make any	16
ill be able to	16
of the answer is	16
are going to become	16
a lot easier to	16
one of the many	16
to protect our parks	16
alter the human body	16
i cant help but	16
because its going to	16
much of the world	16
turns out that theres	16
do not have a	16
cells in those organs	16
so the bottom line	16
it is the only	16
to do things like	16
but there was another	16
but i think it	16
of these planets are	16
on the number of	16
have to talk about	16
they seem to be	16
that we can understand	16
little bit about what	16
like this its a	16
when the earth becomes	16
issues of our time	16
you make plants that	16
so that people can	16
to be more mindful	16
what would be the	16
the face of this	16
entire human genome into	16
is trying to find	16
youve probably heard of	16
and so what i	16
i did when i	16
around the time i	16
what we use to	16
you do when you	16
i could never have	16
to show you something	16
a very large number	16
the next day and	16
and after a while	16
we do at the	16
at any given time	16
up one day and	16
should use machines that	16
we need to buy	16
that we often face	16
old at the time	16
i can look at	16
but i do think	16
out in the middle	16
united states and in	16
of all the other	16
in a row out	16
are a net carbon	16
we can afford to	16
what youre trying to	16
in the southern ocean	16
this is a high	16
do you do when	16
dont know what to	16
want to be involved	16
is such a thing	16
we have a new	16
human thoughts and emotions	16
show you how the	16
youre able to watch	16
so when i first	16
and i asked him	16
this object you see	16
it is one of	16
want to get rid	16
you could see the	16
said to me that	16
that the brain does	16
that we cant see	16
this one over here	16
ios of the mind	16
but it can be	16
are in it together	16
is this going to	16
here we have the	16
to evolve the human	16
im going to find	16
what i did is	16
for a moment and	16
is a great example	16
so much better and	16
im not suggesting that	16
the ability to seek	16
more than 90 percent	16
does somebody want to	16
as well as a	16
you can find out	16
theyre going to have	16
my friends and family	16
of the world so	16
by the time the	16
the whole population of	16
able to watch the	16
have never been more	16
that our world is	16
part of a community	16
for making type i	16
into the next generation	16
this is a kind	16
in the search for	16
and i noticed that	16
so if you were	16
having to do with	16
are very interested in	16
i showed you before	16
and over the next	16
much the same way	16
the more we learn	16
going to be something	16
we are looking at	16
we can understand how	16
neuron subsystem suggests that	16
our culture is flourishing	16
i can do something	16
general theory of relativity	16
from here to the	16
across the world to	16
a better world for	16
from the spaces between	16
a lot of effort	16
to do some of	16
uncertainty that we often	16
some of the amazing	16
is it possible that	16
getting to the point	16
want to make the	16
do this sort of	16
you have heard about	16
between us and the	16
see behind me is	16
an entire human genome	16
i think that if	16
you to join me	16
this is the thing	16
is it getting too	16
to watch the earth	16
lower our uncertainties about	16
you walk into a	16
this is something i	16
to be the best	16
of the media lab	16
there can be no	16
this is a video	16
my first day in	16
a lot of water	16
why am i here	16
make plants that are	16
fact that this is	16
on the main screen	16
think we should be	16
i was the kind	16
if you dont mind	16
together with our partners	16
to sit down and	16
and if we look	16
a way that they	16
if you will and	16
do not think that	16
how do we celebrate	16
and the more we	16
what did we find	16
wanted to be the	16
responsible for making type	16
i did was i	16
take a look back	16
in the arab region	16
entropica is broadly applicable	16
need to know that	16
of world war ii	16
went back to my	16
knowing who were dealing	16
models of individual plants	16
use it as a	16
like the strawberries from	16
about the same time	16
of the benefits of	16
they get integrated into	16
this is not only	16
its made of sugar	16
far more important than	16
theres always going to	16
here is that we	16
stone or a coin	16
part of what we	16
on the continent and	16
ive been talking about	16
to present to you	16
in the business of	16
that we have is	16
what would i be	16
underlying mechanism for intelligence	16
the cells in those	16
for many years now	16
this is that this	16
drop it on the	16
solve the problem of	16
in a world in	16
i really like about	16
remain carbon neutral for	16
dont talk about it	16
i was working with	16
id like to show	16
if you record the	16
this is the real	16
does it achieve the	16
the next 40 years	16
its the language of	16
the statue of liberty	16
do you have a	16
talk to you a	16
most of my time	16
used to be that	16
95 percent of the	16
much for coming to	16
what would that change	16
the world and we	16
has the same skeleton	16
then im going to	16
dont need to go	16
that they had a	16
a part of that	16
together in order to	16
why do we do	16
the needs of the	16
you see here so	16
so i think this	16
four types of resilience	16
we want to create	16
i also think that	16
in the early 1900s	16
youre not supposed to	16
them in a way	16
me out of the	16
but we dont know	16
means is that the	16
here to dream together	16
up to 30 percent	16
i want to point	16
and it looks like	16
want to see what	16
the founder of the	16
talked about how blockchains	16
into the atmosphere and	16
thats not the point	16
10 to 20 percent	16
how many robots you	16
so if you go	16
understand the importance of	16
been a variety of	16
could it be that	16
its no surprise that	16
is only one of	16
much more of a	16
there was a man	16
live a life that	16
world in terms of	16
here we see that	16
i knew i could	16
and in the course	16
people in the boat	16
cells in the brain	16
not knowing who were	16
for the 21st century	16
i was interested in	16
the early days of	16
to save the world	16
im also going to	16
and artist in residence	16
grew up on a	16
imagine that you are	16
maybe you make plants	16
i wanted to see	16
a lot of potential	16
was when i was	16
is probably going to	16
that they can be	16
me to the second	16
and they do that	16
and then i learned	16
to do with you	16
to go through the	16
with respect to the	16
this was in the	16
and the cool thing	16
this is how i	16
many of you in	16
want to do anything	16
to look at how	16
going to use the	16
we set out to	16
across the country and	16
this is taken from	16
when i decided to	16
of us has a	16
in a series of	16
a decentralized database that	16
to be seen as	16
i know its a	16
ive been asking myself	16
new neurons in the	16
i didnt expect to	16
the other person is	16
to be looking for	16
the other side and	16
i want to convince	16
in the palm of	16
on top of everything	16
so when you go	16
of these services dont	16
problem with that is	16
trying to understand why	16
the exact same thing	16
we should use machines	16
want to evolve human	16
learn how to play	16
think theres a lot	16
be a kind of	16
we started asking ourselves	16
are the building blocks	16
as soon as he	16
good news for you	16
perform at a level	16
is to make sure	16
future of food is	16
coming to ted and	16
was not allowed to	16
what could we do	16
to help us think	16
as they get older	16
this gives us a	16
the future of money	16
are really good at	16
plants that are immune	16
variety of different threads	16
i know what you	16
going to make us	16
thats what you see	16
to make that happen	16
way this works is	16
have been a variety	16
we can do something	16
the solar system and	16
ones who care about	16
surface of a planet	16
take a picture of	16
waste from the spaces	16
our economy is small	16
changing the way we	16
was going to do	16
just want to say	16
and the interesting thing	16
the way across the	16
systems in the world	16
only ones who care	16
all of the transactions	16
and we should be	16
and so i just	16
freedom of action and	16
at four in the	16
this is really the	16
and you get the	16
to live in the	16
the most interesting part	16
if we didnt have	16
have a chance to	16
as far as you	16
i think we would	16
if you can do	16
about how to make	16
is probably the biggest	16
to tell him that	16
the production of long	16
want to be treated	16
out if we can	16
going to win this	16
along with lower inertia	16
of you will know	16
i think about the	16
is there life beyond	16
maybe you make them	16
to build a society	16
i think i can	16
then you can see	16
ive talked about how	16
is this is a	16
that was the end	16
and emotions to other	16
you start to get	16
the other thing we	16
how much of the	16
what i really wanted	16
to 20 percent of	16
but if you were	16
weve grown all kinds	16
with an open heart	16
you realize that the	16
and im sure many	16
how we are keeping	16
you record the voices	16
where we need to	16
its going to make	16
that some of you	16
the way it works	16
like a piece of	16
theres too many people	16
more and more complex	16
really have to be	16
and thats a very	16
to alter the human	16
its not because they	16
it might be a	16
want to do more	16
but it has a	16
kind of want to	16
happens when you have	16
do something about this	16
youre lucky enough to	16
the deal is closed	16
of this sort of	16
if there were a	16
is so great that	16
is the number of	16
has been called the	16
we are a carbon	16
i was telling you	16
the higgs boson is	16
babies are going to	16
the technology to do	16
we want to evolve	16
trying to get the	16
we call it the	16
i can go ahead	16
can see this robot	16
neural path of least	16
brings us to the	16
question of whether a	16
up purple paper people	16
to change your perspective	16
the instant gratification monkey	16
look a little bit	16
we are keeping our	16
so what were doing	16
the people of ted	16
but if you dont	16
now it turns out	16
that we know that	16
that are immune to	16
a little bit with	16
or does somebody want	16
this is what a	16
a lot about how	16
i cant say that	16
side of the room	16
not that many boxes	16
landed on the moon	16
in one way or	16
everybody would like to	16
there are millions of	16
i think theres something	16
and i thank you	16
any other kind of	16
been doing is trying	16
to have to do	16
there is a solution	16
energy that we export	16
to show that we	16
did when i was	16
in a place like	16
back to the brain	16
the effects of procrastination	16
make perfect sense of	16
the surface area of	16
which is in the	16
grown all kinds of	16
we didnt want to	16
you to take a	16
carbon neutral for all	16
you are in the	16
end of the curve	16
in a minute youll	16
to step up and	16
so if you take	16
you can do anything	16
when we did that	16
to talk to the	16
the fourth and final	16
the very same time	16
want to alter the	16
to talk to them	16
as much as any	16
material produced by the	16
from this sort of	16
uncomfortable to talk about	16
we can and we	16
tells us a lot	16
going to start by	16
so for the next	16
tell us that the	16
it becomes a moral	16
to be a leader	16
will be the most	16
at the root of	16
tell us a lot	16
for the second time	16
to lower uncertainty about	16
much better and so	16
is very different from	16
no matter where you	16
me and my brother	16
going to go quite	16
a very small number	16
see here is the	16
i was supposed to	16
standing in front of	16
be able to say	16
he wanted to know	16
on their own terms	16
these are things that	16
in yellowstone national park	16
how do you feel	16
to put that in	16
where it came from	16
ethical to enhance a	16
and its estimated that	16
to understand how to	16
very hard to do	16
the area of the	16
with the idea that	16
the past 15 years	16
i said to her	16
who are going to	16
its estimated that by	16
out what it is	16
three meters per second	16
seeing the real thing	16
that she was a	16
energy from the solar	16
need to focus on	16
im going to call	16
and all the rest	16
we are a net	16
youre not talking about	16
day in and day	16
we are in it	16
at the end and	16
is that these robots	16
one day i went	16
spend most of my	16
a net carbon sink	16
where there is no	16
of the university of	16
country is under forest	16
have to say that	16
can be in the	16
does it mean to	16
did a lot of	16
no matter what happens	16
the university of washington	16
but the reality is	16
of thousands of times	16
took a picture of	16
imagine that we had	16
needed to be able	16
you want to spend	16
percent increase in the	16
change in the world	16
we at the hebrew	16
this is from a	16
think of ourselves as	16
see what we do	16
what were seeing is	16
and i love the	16
want to convince you	16
with thousands of people	16
a long story short	16
that you can take	16
we want to talk	16
in and day out	16
will see in the	16
no matter where i	16
it was time to	16
and i think what	16
i happened to be	16
was trying to do	16
as i like to	16
and the reality is	16
on a friday night	16
kinds of things these	16
of the oldest objects	16
making its way into	16
the diversity of possible	16
a row out of	16
define who we are	15
way beyond our own	15
who are able to	15
the human genome project	15
because we are not	15
to realize that this	15
get the world right	15
what you have to	15
and so when you	15
see that the responses	15
on the future of	15
hundreds and thousands of	15
on the spot and	15
i thought this was	15
it does this by	15
as we continue to	15
of the interesting things	15
its our job to	15
now in your brains	15
grow up to be	15
people who are very	15
a place where you	15
in which people can	15
similar to what you	15
or anything like that	15
to 50 percent of	15
to say yes to	15
going to be another	15
compares to their peers	15
when i came back	15
create a better world	15
kind of thing that	15
you dont have that	15
example this is a	15
you want to call	15
talk about the future	15
is a group of	15
world a better place	15
things that have big	15
is that it was	15
you get something like	15
so its sort of	15
it to the next	15
to do is we	15
a way that the	15
to think about they	15
equivalent to that of	15
new way of thinking	15
be a way to	15
take my word for	15
tomato a meter away	15
able to do the	15
of the things thats	15
a bit like this	15
can participate in the	15
it and i think	15
this is because the	15
plant is known as	15
next two dozen years	15
a computer write poetry	15
water on the surface	15
second thing that we	15
the world has changed	15
and what is the	15
reality is not a	15
you may have noticed	15
and i felt like	15
i think that its	15
will choose to alter	15
a lot longer than	15
between the ages of	15
new york city and	15
in a small space	15
has to be about	15
solution to the problem	15
reality of the computer	15
the plant is known	15
that have big teeth	15
without a third party	15
were going to look	15
it seems that we	15
would happen if you	15
what we see in	15
us make better decisions	15
we feel that we	15
how we relate to	15
i felt that i	15
an answer to this	15
not enough just to	15
go back in and	15
of a box of	15
we are the ones	15
come up with the	15
there is a better	15
so we can actually	15
as a member of	15
when i was 17	15
that go into making	15
the past five years	15
a million star systems	15
im proud that i	15
most of the worlds	15
going to come back	15
be the father of	15
we need to use	15
they want you to	15
is some of the	15
want to know is	15
and we can create	15
has a lot to	15
just a lot of	15
and much of the	15
to make it happen	15
back to my office	15
have to wait for	15
of thats going to	15
we need to rethink	15
have been around for	15
my word for it	15
to see what was	15
but i dont want	15
have you ever wondered	15
between rich and poor	15
and im happy to	15
it we need to	15
we were looking at	15
a vast amount of	15
the last few decades	15
to the development of	15
at the back of	15
to make it better	15
are living in the	15
and i am not	15
the scale of the	15
you decide to do	15
when we take this	15
and i were in	15
it was at the	15
you can take out	15
we want to show	15
can see that it	15
of all the people	15
in the rainy season	15
the existence of a	15
thing that you have	15
can look at this	15
what we did we	15
about 15 years ago	15
and if any of	15
i have an experience	15
a little bit deeper	15
the garden of eden	15
the bitcoin blockchain is	15
happens to be a	15
in a country that	15
the world to be	15
in the southern hemisphere	15
are going to use	15
a tenth of a	15
10 to the minus	15
the second thing i	15
red tomato a meter	15
is going on inside	15
make sure that they	15
so on the left	15
during the industrial revolution	15
for one of the	15
what i think we	15
reduce the risk of	15
a lot of natural	15
there a way to	15
that it has a	15
is the moment that	15
we will never be	15
is a long time	15
it is something that	15
what youre doing is	15
i want to discuss	15
over the next 15	15
can a computer write	15
surface of the comet	15
but when i was	15
than people who are	15
what was going to	15
the whole concept of	15
in less than a	15
to push a button	15
there are two ways	15
right around the time	15
in the world on	15
want to go through	15
what we decided to	15
in which we have	15
but at the time	15
we will look back	15
but what we found	15
use it every day	15
to understand how we	15
need to be very	15
about 20 years ago	15
because i was a	15
means we have a	15
the past few decades	15
i feel like i	15
can use to build	15
back to the first	15
a gene drive that	15
and a number of	15
what it sounds like	15
more than four million	15
one thing for sure	15
where there is a	15
you you can go	15
over the world but	15
is where we have	15
the only thing you	15
the equations of evolution	15
weve learned how to	15
as many of you	15
the second one is	15
very much for listening	15
i knew i was	15
wide variety of different	15
to be coupled to	15
you have no idea	15
and then we want	15
are things we can	15
im never going to	15
was to create a	15
have to say about	15
a good example of	15
we have to understand	15
see what we can	15
to explain a little	15
know what youre thinking	15
and that was in	15
could also be used	15
that when i was	15
i just want you	15
is that the world	15
makes it so that	15
we actually look at	15
that i am not	15
is known as the	15
far as i know	15
the unmoving center of	15
the great thing about	15
as often as i	15
pull three blue balls	15
on one of the	15
so the bitcoin blockchain	15
because i am a	15
i thought i had	15
as soon as it	15
but i also know	15
the use of the	15
from some of the	15
can see is that	15
began to think about	15
got out of the	15
over the last year	15
united states digital service	15
when you give them	15
was able to do	15
at all in fact	15
when i talk to	15
but its not a	15
here this is the	15
this was just a	15
look at the first	15
key thing is that	15
around the world have	15
i got an email	15
but let me tell	15
to want to be	15
we need to focus	15
i ended up in	15
expect it to be	15
of trying to get	15
to create economic growth	15
want to make sure	15
your body to find	15
of the people on	15
would like to see	15
way to work and	15
dont know what this	15
do we fix this	15
half the size of	15
need to talk about	15
did not know what	15
comes in the form	15
out of a box	15
to take all of	15
that were interested in	15
me that it was	15
days to get there	15
is a question that	15
what we now know	15
so i dont think	15
the turing test for	15
wanted to be an	15
a few hours later	15
to the next generation	15
a lot of great	15
i dont believe it	15
what i did i	15
not know is that	15
when we have a	15
what i really want	15
at the hands of	15
going on in their	15
died at the age	15
that you can get	15
is not something that	15
im not supposed to	15
the same time its	15
i was in my	15
our place in the	15
in the world but	15
to these kinds of	15
center of the galaxy	15
going to be my	15
to wake up to	15
where its going to	15
going to the moon	15
and i wonder what	15
that are connected to	15
and i went out	15
the world and it	15
because they need to	15
produce a lot of	15
and we try to	15
of dark energy weve	15
there is one thing	15
the life of a	15
that we see the	15
in order to grow	15
were trying to make	15
you look at your	15
that were talking about	15
you have to know	15
what happens in a	15
know how many of	15
and i came up	15
we make sure that	15
were trying to create	15
the second coming of	15
the last one is	15
many of them would	15
why do you think	15
one of the questions	15
so we have this	15
have nothing to do	15
have an experience that	15
the other thing thats	15
for the sake of	15
to start to look	15
know some of you	15
and i believe we	15
think this is one	15
me so much that	15
come home from school	15
is that we get	15
can look at it	15
poem 1 was written	15
then there was the	15
i kept waiting for	15
like the world is	15
people who are more	15
a variety of other	15
and so we decided	15
we really wanted to	15
i got a call	15
know that its a	15
and this is true	15
dont have to deal	15
in the language of	15
does it have to	15
want you to be	15
you cant see it	15
now dont get me	15
of a human hair	15
all they have to	15
for us to get	15
time you see a	15
look at the other	15
thinking about how to	15
of the real world	15
if i could have	15
has led me to	15
theres no way i	15
over the united states	15
but some of them	15
is that it doesnt	15
i dont have an	15
so i came up	15
and thats why were	15
in the corner of	15
wanted to see what	15
able to make it	15
going to do to	15
so what about the	15
of the most influential	15
tell us something about	15
is the one that	15
with the high school	15
when we see it	15
when you come to	15
what happens in the	15
a way for us	15
had to have a	15
a couple of times	15
in a slightly different	15
thats a really good	15
to move away from	15
dont even have to	15
why is this important	15
that are the most	15
you are one of	15
to see what they	15
and i think youll	15
to me as a	15
the meaning of the	15
this is a perfect	15
the difference between a	15
than it needs to	15
of the body that	15
of them have been	15
we have all the	15
now take a look	15
want to point out	15
the goal is to	15
its not unique to	15
lets look at that	15
whether or not the	15
to try and do	15
you can stand on	15
people that you can	15
can learn a lot	15
to do is show	15
why is it so	15
can be found in	15
you about today is	15
has a level of	15
and you can make	15
than you might think	15
i ask the question	15
and so i was	15
the only problem with	15
on the morning of	15
when we look back	15
because if you look	15
and so many others	15
its fair to say	15
you have to find	15
in a sort of	15
in a world of	15
money lets start with	15
is it a place	15
19 percent of the	15
is equivalent to that	15
the world and what	15
take advantage of the	15
and here is a	15
we all see a	15
ill make a ted	15
more than a century	15
the best thing that	15
that i want you	15
part of a much	15
see where this is	15
are really going to	15
and its really hard	15
you change it in	15
what weve done is	15
that we are able	15
50 percent of their	15
im going to turn	15
do we call it	15
how do you find	15
this brings us to	15
to have one of	15
the quality of your	15
and i went on	15
think we should do	15
it was a real	15
would be in the	15
i had to write	15
feel the need to	15
i was not allowed	15
telling me that i	15
have been thinking about	15
history of the world	15
there is going to	15
shown you so far	15
led me to the	15
but i think what	15
to see if you	15
that we dont want	15
do that is to	15
the air but the	15
i didnt really know	15
and thats what it	15
a very different story	15
most of my life	15
on the ground and	15
when you sit down	15
in an age where	15
the extent that we	15
why those people are	15
for me to make	15
here is that the	15
thing that i want	15
a lot of reasons	15
given to us by	15
want to talk a	15
and why is it	15
one of the hardest	15
the best ways to	15
on this planet is	15
which a lot of	15
and the fact is	15
and if you ask	15
communicate with each other	15
out how we can	15
in front of their	15
is to tell you	15
nearly five million people	15
and it goes on	15
here in this room	15
its hard to get	15
tell you about my	15
us back to the	15
who i really am	15
people are choosing to	15
at a tipping point	15
the first person who	15
of the ways that	15
and one of these	15
be able to communicate	15
id like to start	15
of genes that are	15
the right way to	15
it just has to	15
may not know is	15
we should look at	15
point is that we	15
of us who are	15
into the real world	15
and i am so	15
and so in the	15
and some of us	15
in the brain that	15
to tell us what	15
is the difference between	15
what should we do	15
which is to take	15
make sense of it	15
the one that we	15
way to make a	15
the first tv debate	15
the people on the	15
we have to figure	15
how can we make	15
how am i going	15
that we have with	15
not meant to be	15
help us make better	15
wherever they want to	15
see what the baby	15
size of the planet	15
so a lot of	15
you wanted to get	15
its the most powerful	15
that reality is not	15
on the behavior of	15
it wasnt until i	15
was a young man	15
are the only ones	15
may seem like a	15
consciousness is not a	15
we saw a lot	15
remind us that we	15
so i dont know	15
what we realized is	15
about five years ago	15
and so we have	15
its called the blockchain	15
what we think we	15
the things that inspire	15
is the message that	15
of the brain so	15
now what i want	15
over the last 30	15
but there was something	15
and all of our	15
islamic state and others	15
one and the same	15
the gender wage gap	15
at 10 times the	15
to think of this	15
but if you go	15
do anything you want	15
up with a way	15
pay compares to their	15
and it seems like	15
have never seen before	15
a lot of women	15
havent been able to	15
youre going to make	15
thats kind of the	15
i think these are	15
so this is why	15
wrote a book called	15
i believe we can	15
one of my friends	15
going to do in	15
whatever you want to	15
people who are like	15
and by doing so	15
and what kind of	15
has got to be	15
the way we live	15
i was 14 years	15
its a function of	15
first part of the	15
the two of us	15
you were in the	15
and every single day	15
different points of view	15
of my favorite examples	15
what the baby does	15
in all of these	15
single one of the	15
but at some point	15
going on over there	15
that we can think	15
of you is going	15
one has to do	15
billionth of a second	15
the world and so	15
percent of the planet	15
here we are in	15
she was talking about	15
so we started looking	15
and there are two	15
and if you were	15
thats not a good	15
and the idea of	15
do you remember when	15
more to do with	15
of the quality of	15
the marathon im running	15
every single aspect of	15
there is a new	15
we would have to	15
this needs to be	15
we dont know and	15
we can use this	15
but that reality is	15
these men and women	15
rocks of the right	15
thousands of years to	15
i can be a	15
a red tomato a	15
we all have to	15
to a place of	15
we were trained to	15
for the extra dimensions	15
the first step is	15
thats the reality of	15
you is going to	15
things have in common	15
come up with this	15
and then we had	15
started a company to	15
theres no question hes	15
we wouldnt have to	15
what that tells us	15
of all of this	15
so what we have	15
question you have to	15
those of you that	15
in the aftermath of	15
that our universe is	15
the origin of species	15
take a lot longer	15
the sum of all	15
women of color in	15
and we do it	15
human beings have been	15
made it possible for	15
but whats interesting is	15
a lot of power	15
at the molecular level	15
that we cant even	15
five percent of the	15
to the number of	15
if we dont do	15
an experience that i	15
that i read about	15
when i grew up	15
willing to work hard	15
all of our problems	15
not going to tell	15
generation of young people	15
better and so much	15
imagine for a moment	15
think that this was	15
two of the most	15
but i hope that	15
they dont need to	15
a lot of energy	15
lets see what the	15
are happening in the	15
step out of the	15
so what does that	15
about a problem of	15
the right kind of	15
live in one of	15
90 percent of our	15
more important than the	15
and when i look	15
is a very complicated	15
this was the most	15
about what to do	15
of the world what	15
so what have we	15
see that this is	15
that are going on	15
of you have been	15
over thousands of years	15
its going to change	15
which is just a	15
is an idea that	15
redemption songs redemption songs	15
dont have to go	15
what were looking at	15
that means that you	15
for that is that	15
an important role in	15
we care about the	15
over the world and	15
couple of years later	15
are just at the	15
i have a dream	15
we can actually use	15
they should be able	15
the hum of the	15
in the event of	15
and so we were	15
that the responses in	15
and gets into the	15
to create something that	15
a suit of armor	15
poem was written by	15
for their survival and	15
the failed religion of	15
and the end of	15
it looks a little	15
it and this is	15
i had the opportunity	15
you know how many	15
to be at least	15
in other countries and	15
hyowon is going to	15
in the field that	15
what did we do	15
one of us can	15
on the south pole	15
of the united kingdom	15
a couple of minutes	15
we get the world	15
on our ability to	15
the here and now	15
for two and a	15
of what we think	15
take the time to	15
think about how much	15
thats not how we	15
and no matter how	15
for us to remember	15
just going to show	15
and this is so	15
with you some of	15
gap between rich and	15
if youre lucky enough	15
probably one of the	15
to learn about the	15
ive done it with	15
could be one of	15
is going to start	15
of the human brain	15
and as i was	15
that tells us is	15
about a lot of	15
largest economy in the	15
this is all great	15
going to do anything	15
love the way that	15
but it also means	15
go a little bit	15
to recognize that this	15
when they get to	15
to come together and	15
never going to get	15
what if we had	15
that kind of thing	15
you fall in love	15
that was a little	15
it comes from the	15
you think it was	15
out of thin air	15
the nation im building	15
we have to provide	15
even though it was	15
the united states digital	15
to do it right	15
is a list of	15
is a really weird	15
need to know about	15
like a chess game	15
i had to say	15
as a red tomato	15
the world we live	15
will be helping us	15
that all of the	15
second coming of christ	15
a photograph of a	15
lot of natural gas	15
that this is my	15
we had to find	15
each of you to	15
to tell me what	15
we dont do that	15
and in the world	15
theres a group of	15
think im going to	15
is a piece of	15
most people think that	15
its the idea of	15
just told you about	15
you get to see	15
and a few years	15
to remind us of	15
is the work of	15
but theres a second	15
there used to be	15
the way we are	15
that youre interested in	15
describe as a red	15
nothing at all to	15
have to work with	15
we can say that	15
and so you see	15
kind of like an	15
and i heard the	15
we want you to	15
every single person in	15
and so im going	15
but we want to	15
of the right age	15
but that wasnt the	15
the stories we tell	15
like to speak about	15
if you change it	15
the next two dozen	15
its going to go	15
also have to have	15
i had never seen	15
a couple of them	15
i got out of	15
to find out whats	15
in the lower right	15
important to realize that	15
how in the world	15
and we have all	15
because it is a	15
where we dont have	15
to do their bidding	15
is a big problem	15
there are more than	15
and there was this	15
a box of mostly	15
lot of talk about	15
we have to work	15
hope that we can	15
here is a picture	15
doing the work of	15
and there are risks	15
is the key to	15
and just like that	15
talking to each other	15
i dont think theres	15
and thats why its	15
looked at it and	15
to interact with the	15
how important it is	15
economy in the world	15
of people who were	15
say i want to	15
1 was written by	15
now a lot of	15
we are just at	15
i always like to	15
a kind of cosmic	15
ask yourself this question	15
was part of a	15
and then theres a	15
and then we asked	15
and what i think	15
its because of the	15
that you can be	15
size of the earth	15
they had no idea	15
and then you can	15
i was not going	15
supposed to be about	15
you can see there	15
the way we look	15
the surface of this	15
the important point here	14
that i dont have	14
you want to talk	14
thank you i have	14
the leading cause of	14
and what is it	14
100 percent of their	14
in toilets on trains	14
we have nothing to	14
i see a lot	14
way that you can	14
the last one and	14
at the new yorker	14
id like to know	14
14 orders of magnitude	14
theyre the ones that	14
the words of the	14
they look like this	14
in front of her	14
obsessed with grades and	14
to the people in	14
one of the characters	14
longer than i think	14
come to me and	14
lying on the floor	14
the purpose of this	14
you want to come	14
lets think about what	14
my computer and i	14
i was on a	14
this is the stuff	14
but what happens when	14
out to be really	14
potential effects of climate	14
but there are other	14
have a list of	14
if we do that	14
only animals that laugh	14
world thats going to	14
millions of computers and	14
for us why doesnt	14
not going to talk	14
i think its important	14
a clean energy revolution	14
at the turn of	14
at least some of	14
i think that nature	14
weve never seen before	14
that i like to	14
do you think its	14
you want it to	14
one of the features	14
this is a particularly	14
and we were all	14
wanted to tell you	14
it all over the	14
in the whole world	14
which we look at	14
pieces of paper and	14
of the digital age	14
but it could be	14
if you know what	14
this is not going	14
you can analyze your	14
end up in the	14
it was because of	14
lets look at what	14
dont have the time	14
one of the worst	14
we can go back	14
last one and a	14
i was doing a	14
a part of it	14
theres just one problem	14
in the front row	14
what weve seen in	14
humans are the only	14
people out there who	14
the harvard grant study	14
this is what our	14
when you hear laughter	14
figured out a way	14
so i started looking	14
a mindset that says	14
we put it back	14
if we could have	14
we have developed a	14
and that leads to	14
did i just say	14
it can make us	14
i was sort of	14
if you could bring	14
from a different perspective	14
and now you have	14
is there a single	14
we actually have a	14
need to do it	14
how many jobs there	14
neither of those things	14
raw material to justify	14
we could try to	14
a robot that can	14
to the north pole	14
allow us to explore	14
understand laughter fully by	14
that we actually can	14
thats what weve been	14
of the motor neurons	14
to work in a	14
the one to tell	14
stay ahead of the	14
been around for a	14
see this in the	14
what you could do	14
the second principle is	14
of a piece of	14
in order to find	14
so i was like	14
when i first got	14
you take a look	14
weve changed the chemistry	14
think that if you	14
that it is the	14
what i would do	14
i think what we	14
of course there are	14
of the city and	14
but it is also	14
every aspect of our	14
fact that we dont	14
on the outskirts of	14
that the cost of	14
to do with my	14
we have a problem	14
is you have to	14
pretty much like the	14
something that we can	14
i also know that	14
they werent going to	14
its not the same	14
the first people to	14
would like to talk	14
say that this is	14
series of missions to	14
of the clean energy	14
things were going to	14
what i would call	14
to work at a	14
some places in the	14
we have to unleash	14
we see that in	14
there life beyond earth	14
secreted at the axon	14
that the rate of	14
talk about some of	14
that there is an	14
not just the grades	14
forgotten how to see	14
theres a lot more	14
do that in a	14
cents a mile we	14
and when we do	14
think about it for	14
admission to a tiny	14
i cant do everything	14
to the level of	14
first era of the	14
two thirds of the	14
you have to understand	14
was like we were	14
in a study done	14
there is a problem	14
because i had to	14
around the world for	14
were in a clean	14
we teach girls to	14
research has shown that	14
learned how to do	14
really excited about this	14
the year of the	14
announced that they were	14
the world as a	14
this kind of a	14
find out the truth	14
i know that they	14
this is how much	14
sure that we can	14
faster than the speed	14
we start to have	14
but the thing that	14
in the checklisted childhood	14
even though most of	14
to make us feel	14
so i had a	14
front of me and	14
at the point where	14
and they didnt have	14
the way to work	14
and then i put	14
order of magnitude in	14
theres no code that	14
is why i can	14
fully by the time	14
i want to change	14
of the problems with	14
have one thing in	14
the first era of	14
i had the chance	14
told me that it	14
that we need a	14
as time goes on	14
so what happens when	14
as a part of	14
of a small country	14
means that theres a	14
a sense of purpose	14
the next few days	14
the idea that if	14
you can get that	14
tell you one thing	14
graduated from high school	14
the amount of water	14
subjectivity as features of	14
one of the founders	14
find it associated with	14
in mind for them	14
see what kind of	14
a group of scientists	14
the first time weve	14
there are other things	14
i was about to	14
the last hundred years	14
and theyre not going	14
lot longer than i	14
marry when i want	14
aspect of our lives	14
of you are thinking	14
and you have the	14
very existence of consciousness	14
we look at a	14
very smart people are	14
under the wedding canopy	14
they might end up	14
better care of our	14
people with intellectual disabilities	14
i had to travel	14
do this as a	14
it also means that	14
were not supposed to	14
the united states government	14
i dont like it	14
mile we could get	14
but i will say	14
it may be that	14
but what i do	14
if you are not	14
to the people who	14
to realize is that	14
say that they are	14
and she looked at	14
to find out who	14
it gives you the	14
to look like this	14
theres nothing to worry	14
can you imagine how	14
be comfortable with imperfection	14
the last few weeks	14
you what you could	14
of people trying to	14
and in the future	14
does that have to	14
this is in a	14
have the will to	14
diseases like alzheimers and	14
and the size of	14
heart of our traditions	14
actions lead to outcomes	14
we figure out the	14
is a very good	14
take the lead in	14
remember the first time	14
changed my life forever	14
the patterns in the	14
the world food programme	14
its time for us	14
but that is not	14
look into the future	14
than the speed of	14
same thing happens when	14
to do something with	14
the other thing to	14
for longer than any	14
access to the same	14
about the relationship between	14
that happens is that	14
the next four years	14
one extra order of	14
one of the more	14
to do with a	14
of the nervous system	14
will allow you to	14
some of the first	14
i want to build	14
it is essentially a	14
goes on in the	14
a big chunk of	14
style of parenting these	14
computer program running in	14
is not the case	14
the process by which	14
im happy to say	14
from a place of	14
how do we use	14
but in any case	14
over the side and	14
do our work for	14
and along the way	14
learning how to play	14
of us have the	14
some point in your	14
we do not have	14
for a few minutes	14
if you know this	14
is what it is	14
and why do we	14
that much time to	14
im going to just	14
and im not alone	14
in the world this	14
it goes up and	14
the importance of the	14
have to be careful	14
not a good thing	14
the consequence of that	14
if you give them	14
judgment and our creativity	14
the way we manage	14
i went over to	14
is going down the	14
a story about the	14
over the last 50	14
a world thats going	14
the creation of a	14
in the present moment	14
than we have in	14
the most important tools	14
and then i start	14
i wanted to share	14
earth is the only	14
the center of this	14
just the kind of	14
is some encouraging news	14
technology magnifies our leverage	14
does that look like	14
ill show you what	14
climate models in the	14
if you see a	14
set out to try	14
depending on the behavior	14
is sort of a	14
you multiply that by	14
dont have to worry	14
with the things that	14
you find is that	14
that change the climate	14
the third principle is	14
its real and irreducible	14
can see that theres	14
of the world is	14
by the us and	14
now we know that	14
at a rate of	14
in all kinds of	14
have something to do	14
a lot of really	14
we think we can	14
a sheet of paper	14
that the rest of	14
on this is the	14
in order to save	14
we come up with	14
did i have to	14
we did was we	14
we all want to	14
who would have thought	14
and wherever you find	14
ones own actions lead	14
a chance to go	14
you think youre a	14
it in the right	14
up and run away	14
of the universe and	14
in this part of	14
increasingly do our work	14
but what do you	14
lot of the things	14
have to leave the	14
are there ways to	14
how close it is	14
friends of mine who	14
have a better understanding	14
i want to help	14
you the story of	14
in iraq and afghanistan	14
have been socialized to	14
was going to work	14
struck me was the	14
up in a world	14
and like i said	14
that are present in	14
can see from this	14
the african risk capacity	14
this is an actual	14
to have access to	14
on the brink of	14
on social media and	14
the full range of	14
this work is that	14
too much time on	14
looks like this is	14
that might have been	14
and that we are	14
which means that we	14
a level of description	14
sending you a copy	14
with grades and scores	14
i just say chores	14
and you can get	14
what that does to	14
is what i mean	14
a change in the	14
you think of a	14
the internet of information	14
that is that you	14
our plant food supplies	14
i want to explain	14
he was diagnosed with	14
laughs are shown in	14
your feelings about the	14
laughter and when you	14
of the arctic ocean	14
of desiccation tolerance in	14
you today is that	14
and as i look	14
the purification of the	14
a lot of very	14
that you see on	14
have to be willing	14
the streets of cairo	14
from the new york	14
know almost nothing about	14
what you do is	14
the highest levels of	14
we can think about	14
of our intellectual culture	14
youre thinking of the	14
as if you were	14
we do not need	14
a picture of me	14
told me that the	14
a series of missions	14
that when you look	14
and its the same	14
he came up with	14
i lost my sight	14
then i start to	14
i thought i saw	14
you may not be	14
the loss of the	14
of them are in	14
we dont even need	14
so let me take	14
was born in the	14
the total number of	14
objectivity and subjectivity as	14
we are not creating	14
with the rise of	14
to live on mars	14
around the southern oceans	14
all the kinds of	14
it makes a lot	14
supposed to be in	14
distinction between how things	14
a fraction of the	14
is just as important	14
percent of the wealth	14
that we could actually	14
to live like this	14
live in an era	14
in life comes from	14
this is all very	14
have in the world	14
the red line is	14
the world it is	14
so what we can	14
this for a long	14
been doing that for	14
its pretty clear that	14
of us here today	14
of the american public	14
have made a choice	14
thats what were doing	14
have a little bit	14
and even though the	14
air pollution and climate	14
dont understand laughter fully	14
of a human and	14
what its all about	14
over hundreds of thousands	14
share housework and childcare	14
wanted to push a	14
new types of conflicts	14
of climate change and	14
just a few weeks	14
talk about those three	14
i think of the	14
contain the raw material	14
was telling me about	14
but more than that	14
this in a very	14
you look at what	14
dont have a lot	14
and then put it	14
a generation of people	14
of the most critical	14
they were more likely	14
think that nature is	14
build a conscious machine	14
and i saw a	14
the main thing i	14
we do not know	14
out of the same	14
to what you might	14
a paradox our machines	14
our ability to understand	14
to 90 percent of	14
my time thinking about	14
who was going to	14
doesnt mean anything in	14
reclaim the heart of	14
but she was also	14
it may not be	14
the raw material to	14
and its a big	14
its got no water	14
who care about nature	14
but its more than	14
more than a million	14
so i think theres	14
you dont understand laughter	14
women are less likely	14
fact of the matter	14
proud of who they	14
that its got a	14
you see here in	14
the first place and	14
and thats why we	14
as we go around	14
and the same event	14
won the nobel prize	14
need to find ways	14
am i supposed to	14
work for us why	14
in the right classes	14
in many of the	14
i thought i would	14
we were in a	14
climate change is a	14
and i was trying	14
it consciously seems to	14
feel a little bit	14
do better than that	14
layer on top of	14
and what im going	14
was sitting in a	14
if we unleash our	14
the flip side of	14
of us who have	14
certain style of parenting	14
but there is no	14
this is a wonderful	14
15 percent of the	14
about people who are	14
is a very complex	14
of the house and	14
going to come from	14
and how can we	14
actually be able to	14
but we also need	14
place where you can	14
the safety of the	14
you will find that	14
but we didnt know	14
and i see this	14
to 30 percent of	14
so first of all	14
not have the ability	14
i disagree with this	14
and so what id	14
in a certain way	14
the last 15 years	14
emma lazarus was right	14
u doesnt mean anything	14
texts as directives for	14
so heres what i	14
have to do a	14
a little bit less	14
im not quite sure	14
thats kind of a	14
news is that the	14
want to know the	14
of my life it	14
were going to ask	14
that doesnt know how	14
it was not the	14
find ourselves in a	14
are there so many	14
i get a lot	14
a mile we could	14
that they know theyre	14
in a part of	14
plates of the motor	14
machines increasingly do our	14
but i think the	14
many of us think	14
out of the air	14
it is time for	14
do you really think	14
be able to detect	14
one out of three	14
we started to be	14
we had to work	14
so why is it	14
on the top right	14
it doesnt make sense	14
billion people in the	14
this is the answer	14
if youve got a	14
really want to do	14
so what did we	14
not seem like a	14
of life on earth	14
we could have a	14
extra order of magnitude	14
an objective science of	14
the source of a	14
asked me if i	14
take a little bit	14
our work for us	14
with lots of different	14
bill gates is in	14
at the south pole	14
i found it in	14
it is not enough	14
a lot more interesting	14
leave you with is	14
of the history of	14
we have in mind	14
to work with these	14
see that there are	14
i dont know that	14
places that we love	14
have in mind for	14
of my time thinking	14
before i was born	14
he was in the	14
that means that the	14
think you have to	14
in this world that	14
to be involved in	14
between how things consciously	14
thats going to exist	14
when you give people	14
we are about to	14
tell you about one	14
thousands of years and	14
day of the week	14
in the same place	14
what they can do	14
all of our conscious	14
were looking at is	14
we know now that	14
have to take responsibility	14
and in that moment	14
by the presence of	14
the last four years	14
you find it associated	14
may have heard of	14
real and posed laughter	14
and its no wonder	14
thousands or tens of	14
in the next video	14
real and irreducible you	14
to run out of	14
grades and scores and	14
it means we have	14
you like to see	14
ago with the high	14
think of them as	14
as we try to	14
is true of all	14
want to be part	14
that the gap between	14
will look back at	14
you cant make a	14
i think in the	14
move on to the	14
start by telling you	14
should be in the	14
i grew up on	14
a comprehensive understanding of	14
last year in the	14
was a very interesting	14
and it needs to	14
in their roots and	14
just trying to be	14
for people who are	14
the gap between rich	14
if you believe that	14
and a half decades	14
to go back home	14
now why is that	14
a pretty good job	14
into the right college	14
that we tend to	14
we need to structure	14
want to be on	14
as long as theyre	14
what you see on	14
so we were looking	14
fact that he was	14
are people who have	14
as you possibly can	14
came up with an	14
at it as a	14
their roots and leaves	14
the expansion of the	14
to put it into	14
compare that to the	14
that need to be	14
what if instead of	14
ends up in the	14
and the virtual you	14
jobs for our youth	14
the reason i think	14
and each one has	14
get to the top	14
i think that is	14
of the biggest ones	14
i came out of	14
why should we care	14
mars in its past	14
a generation that doesnt	14
probably the most powerful	14
and his friends are	14
to be a man	14
me and she said	14
is not a question	14
not one but two	14
enough to be able	14
dont have all the	14
observations of the future	14
the potential effects of	14
going to be working	14
is a type of	14
or one of the	14
got to make sure	14
not in what we	14
and theyll talk about	14
but it was too	14
what actually happened the	14
one of those people	14
one of the very	14
and how they really	14
first thing im going	14
for what it is	14
in my living room	14
times the size of	14
were going to show	14
you might be saying	14
thought that was the	14
to build a conscious	14
proud to say that	14
at the north pole	14
that we can then	14
the fact that weve	14
how is it possible	14
and that sort of	14
and what you can	14
does that mean for	14
to have a conversation	14
somebody whos on the	14
now this is an	14
get us to a	14
think is going to	14
having an affair with	14
talked a lot about	14
a way that i	14
a better future for	14
think of all the	14
to work with a	14
id like to leave	14
explain to you what	14
youre giving up on	14
to make it work	14
being able to make	14
want to spend the	14
to invest in the	14
that we can keep	14
in the here and	14
know that one of	14
so it can be	14
i have a very	14
percent of our electricity	14
paradox our machines increasingly	14
dont want to go	14
and subjectivity as features	14
we now know as	14
of space and time	14
what seems to be	14
what will happen to	14
wherever you find it	14
and as you go	14
the information that we	14
apply it to the	14
move away from the	14
to see if the	14
to drop out of	14
is not so much	14
im about to whip	14
cannot develop in the	14
laughter fully by the	14
to the rule of	14
where were going to	14
but what if that	14
the problem is its	14
when i say this	14
we began to see	14
roots and leaves of	14
they would have to	14
to raise my arm	14
54 cents a mile	14
because it is the	14
the heart of our	14
this is the result	14
for me it was	14
i knew it was	14
is that they are	14
on the right and	14
the fact of the	14
here im going to	14
dont even know what	14
in a place called	14
matter very much so	14
colleges want to see	14
it could have been	14
not one of them	14
the left side of	14
of things going on	14
want to run a	14
most people in the	14
they can tell you	14
era of the internet	14
and over the course	14
of our plant food	14
i encourage you to	14
how they really are	14
really something else its	14
part of our brain	14
i thought about this	14
doing is taking this	14
to tell this story	14
to go on a	14
no code that says	14
so we were able	14
in the world thats	14
and in terms of	14
a very interesting thing	14
when we teach girls	14
about 20 percent of	14
you can kind of	14
that may not be	14
i realized i have	14
we have not been	14
trying to understand it	14
you just look at	14
in the world now	14
so imagine if we	14
and here we have	14
what if it could	14
less than half a	14
put your hand up	14
of their lives and	14
that you can stand	14
dont know how much	14
it doesnt mean we	14
we know that thats	14
where are we going	14
have a great career	14
and accolades and awards	14
to ted and sharing	14
one of the really	14
the car is going	14
mechanisms of desiccation tolerance	14
in the past two	14
and its one that	14
which we can use	14
go to a place	14
i was on the	14
im talking to you	14
and many of these	14
the basis of the	14
have a generation that	14
think thats a really	14
as important as the	14
because they will be	14
we know almost nothing	14
as much energy as	14
look at what we	14
for admission to a	14
and i think theres	14
i am with my	14
that professional success in	14
i believe that this	14
us who care about	14
we often talk about	14
know the difference between	14
a couple of these	14
and its just a	14
going to be possible	14
are going to die	14
years of age i	14
that they were able	14
the only thing we	14
they have to invest	14
but before i do	14
of you might be	14
any one of you	14
its not about the	14
was sort of a	14
by a guy called	14
what i would like	14
but they can also	14
surface of the earth	14
show you next is	14
of my work is	14
went to school and	14
who are trying to	14
professional success in life	14
is a form of	14
a phone call from	14
give it a try	14
i was 33 years	14
was 33 years old	14
percent of the qualifications	14
to the top and	14
our machines increasingly do	14
the guy on the	14
of who they are	14
single person in this	14
do a better job	14
to be in this	14
didnt want to come	14
of our conscious states	14
just as we were	14
people will be able	14
and they tell us	14
about two and a	14
are you saying that	14
when i saw that	14
going to describe a	14
to deal with it	14
look at this and	14
is a photograph of	14
is just going to	14
turns out that people	14
a profound impact on	14
going to go into	14
whos on the other	14
and what do they	14
are now in the	14
up to us to	14
that they ought to	14
to tell you why	14
when men share housework	14
a better understanding of	14
them to be brave	14
wanted it to be	14
take away from this	14
can do better than	14
came to be known	14
this idea that you	14
a week or two	14
generation that doesnt know	14
so strong that it	14
is whats going to	14
for some of you	14
in order to generate	14
than you would have	14
have so much to	14
of young people who	14
but somewhere along the	14
right now there are	14
its a much bigger	14
we can use it	14
i walked into the	14
there is no other	14
would have thought that	14
we should be doing	14
was a kind of	14
own actions lead to	14
that men and women	14
if you saw the	14
that has ever been	14
i have to speak	14
to think of the	14
i was so excited	14
what you see are	14
gates is in china	14
and i dont like	14
way we manage our	14
need to know how	14
you may be asking	14
going to be this	14
good people doing good	14
you a few examples	14
me show you some	14
in the interest of	14
out from the crowd	14
we have to show	14
good friend of mine	14
so much for coming	14
so here i was	14
of parenting these days	14
this is a song	14
they have a very	14
a look at what	14
the united states i	14
the question is whether	14
of every one of	14
to do something new	14
its as if we	14
do we turn all	14
our judgment and our	14
we dont know yet	14
time to be a	14
started looking at the	14
this time is different	14
on top of each	14
its really something else	14
in this new world	14
couldnt wait to get	14
an affair with the	14
like to make drought	14
a little bit too	14
the real laughs are	14
to know each other	14
i dont think it	14
of the new yorker	14
to do it again	14
raising our girls to	14
and i hope you	14
of the reasons is	14
running out of work	14
had the privilege of	14
could go on and	14
to admit that we	14
us something about the	14
the past several years	14
you can count on	14
come a long way	14
but as you can	14
ive been living in	14
i really began to	14
in study after study	14
button and get a	14
if you start by	14
100 percent of our	14
and the kinds of	14
the war in iraq	14
and get a ride	14
because its a very	14
this moment in time	14
you have to own	14
of the internet and	14
the top of a	14
maybe a little bit	14
looked at the data	14
in the space of	14
that he wanted to	14
at this moment in	14
i would have been	14
im fascinated by the	14
done a good job	14
i ran for congress	14
that live in the	14
would expect to see	14
going on here is	14
this is why you	14
there has to be	14
would you feel if	14
be able to afford	14
and thats what you	14
got a bit of	14
girls to be brave	14
a certain style of	14
but what did we	14
fact that there are	14
to take over the	14
it wasnt a very	14
the mechanisms of desiccation	14
we think we know	14
and you dont need	14
the skill associated with	14
with this idea of	14
of our lives and	14
how to make nuclear	14
nine out of 10	14
if you think the	14
over a third of	14
is a world thats	14
had to do to	14
theres a bunch of	14
how do we take	14
of description where its	14
and this means that	14
do this with the	14
how things consciously seem	14
the question you have	14
the logic of the	14
in order to answer	14
thought a lot about	14
have some of the	14
and we have no	14
in terms of their	14
on the idea that	14
we have a brain	14
and to give you	14
a room full of	14
its more than that	14
not a matter of	14
it i think we	14
working on this for	14
of us who care	14
of the white house	14
and we were in	14
its really easy to	14
and how does that	14
behavior of the molecules	14
we know is that	14
the atmosphere on mars	14
the middle of all	14
so much about the	14
disagree with this i	14
for me to do	14
rising to this challenge	14
and then there is	14
what weve been able	14
in the morning when	14
five or six years	14
a u doesnt mean	14
in the production of	14
life beyond earth in	14
and the quality of	14
when we want to	14
point in your life	14
generation of people who	14
the idea that you	14
this is also a	14
for the next generation	14
in the whole of	14
what does that have	14
if you think its	14
the economy as a	14
as closely as possible	14
we have to embrace	14
but ive come to	14
is the gay agenda	14
i think of it	14
and its very exciting	14
go up to the	14
we as human beings	14
important point here is	14
and im here to	14
economy as a whole	14
all of you have	14
of my life and	14
teach girls to be	14
ill get back to	14
what to do next	14
to talk about your	14
turn this into a	14
and in doing so	14
do such a thing	14
stuck in the ground	14
we do in the	14
it were going to	14
we dont know if	14
that look like this	14
something thats going to	14
this all over the	14
going to be enough	14
how we do it	14
it is that they	14
and why this is	14
why do we not	14
lot of people have	14
lot of things in	14
tell you that its	14
through the process of	14
people doing good work	14
you want to sell	14
a good place to	14
have the answer to	14
we could ask the	14
that we may not	14
they know theyre going	14
but there is something	14
what wed like to	14
have been on the	14
a work in progress	14
of the things you	14
which all of you	14
coming down the road	14
of the most extraordinary	14
tried to figure out	14
tell you how i	14
to get the same	14
more interested in the	14
thought in my brain	14
we need to save	14
the early 20th century	14
me tell you that	14
there wont be any	14
i think thats what	14
in the lower left	14
the age of five	14
which im going to	14
and this is important	14
that it would have	14
spent most of my	14
we have so much	14
in a world with	14
when you get to	14
i have spent the	14
that we have this	14
in which we look	14
but of course we	14
develop in the dark	14
theres a certain style	14
was about 10 years	14
if i was going	14
vast majority of the	14
at the axon end	14
see what was happening	14
the south pole and	14
a force for good	14
but to understand how	14
many of us would	14
so it looks like	14
in the next two	14
theres one thing that	14
that so many of	14
you can use it	14
that you might not	14
here is some encouraging	14
to look at all	14
more likely to have	14
what you get is	14
some of the people	14
and on the left	14
it was as if	14
are on the very	14
and two months later	14
for a few days	14
end up in a	14
coming back to the	14
group of people that	14
you hear somebody laughing	14
im not interested in	14
men share housework and	14
so i would say	14
and these things are	14
can go back and	14
what people are doing	14
then you will be	14
right here at the	14
thing we did was	13
do something like that	13
so for the first	13
this is something we	13
where are they going	13
let me be clear	13
the way that he	13
to address climate change	13
and look at our	13
earth is going to	13
the theory of the	13
so many other things	13
billion and a half	13
to work hard to	13
to create the illusion	13
so to give you	13
looking at here is	13
being able to have	13
we are almost there	13
of a variety of	13
seemed to be the	13
of you have ever	13
what ive been doing	13
the activity of the	13
take into account the	13
we also have an	13
difference between these two	13
the world a little	13
on one side of	13
in desperate need of	13
to explain what that	13
going to work with	13
that needed to be	13
as much as it	13
as good as the	13
have to find the	13
the lives of others	13
we need to stay	13
for a moment about	13
doing a good job	13
when i found out	13
to do this and	13
and we looked at	13
to do is build	13
weve got to go	13
determine if there was	13
you see where this	13
what was happening in	13
when you make a	13
i got a job	13
you get a lot	13
just staring at the	13
soon as you start	13
so that we dont	13
important it is to	13
all that sort of	13
the moment when the	13
something that we dont	13
through the plant and	13
and perhaps in the	13
as i got older	13
a short period of	13
to go around the	13
is telling the truth	13
taught me about the	13
10 years after the	13
got to go in	13
put them on the	13
the tree of life	13
for hundreds of thousands	13
it was supposed to	13
percent of their time	13
at the start of	13
you are talking about	13
lot of things that	13
that are being used	13
to do it for	13
but some of the	13
one of the smallest	13
my life and my	13
and thats not a	13
im not here to	13
i have learned to	13
the ability to understand	13
we need to build	13
at a variety of	13
when we find a	13
to have the courage	13
them out of their	13
the invention of the	13
in a kind of	13
im giving this talk	13
still have a lot	13
integral part of our	13
a yes or no	13
you can see me	13
put this in the	13
we have to address	13
it was quite a	13
small part of the	13
no one seems to	13
of us like to	13
we fall in love	13
to sit on the	13
to work together to	13
the second aspect of	13
me give you two	13
do so by working	13
a lot and i	13
and i would have	13
all of this and	13
ive never met a	13
here is an example	13
be great if we	13
of you who have	13
everyone in the world	13
and you start to	13
just in case you	13
there was a great	13
would be free to	13
but what does it	13
were running out of	13
it and we are	13
to many of you	13
since the dawn of	13
were able to work	13
zoom in to the	13
and we continue to	13
we have a little	13
every part of the	13
we can do things	13
have no idea if	13
the spinal cord is	13
that would be very	13
to do about it	13
lost the ability to	13
a way that it	13
we can start with	13
way were going to	13
we dont see the	13
and we will be	13
has found a way	13
so were not going	13
problems in the world	13
they are the same	13
of every kind of	13
every day in the	13
we want to change	13
i like to say	13
if we have the	13
connected to each other	13
going to be as	13
to learn about a	13
with a personal computer	13
i dream of a	13
had something to do	13
and looking at the	13
hour of the day	13
blink of an eye	13
in a very similar	13
amazing thing about this	13
the benefits of the	13
the world for the	13
do we do about	13
and then were going	13
to say nothing of	13
the depths of the	13
thats not really happening	13
and the way you	13
who happens to be	13
asking the wrong question	13
so the next step	13
each one of them	13
the second one was	13
about how do we	13
small amount of money	13
verge of an epic	13
its not fair to	13
sounds like a lot	13
it was way too	13
there were a couple	13
so you have a	13
see that in the	13
which by the way	13
and i came back	13
as if i had	13
that would mean that	13
you drive down the	13
to get a better	13
but what is the	13
us when it comes	13
put a bunch of	13
came back to the	13
how do you want	13
as a tool to	13
by the shape of	13
what youll see is	13
we found activity in	13
that most of our	13
not going to see	13
and i have found	13
the gravity of the	13
i said to him	13
when they have a	13
the language of the	13
probably not going to	13
i think its because	13
is part of our	13
its important for us	13
my question to you	13
and i grew up	13
youre thinking of that	13
really interesting question is	13
also one of the	13
do that kind of	13
and more than that	13
do this with a	13
can use it to	13
to the power of	13
so i started thinking	13
i always dreamt of	13
so as a result	13
the late 19th century	13
twice as likely to	13
that affects all of	13
get people interested in	13
working on this problem	13
in a hundred years	13
they are in the	13
for quite a long	13
i wanted to get	13
i learned was that	13
how can we use	13
get the impression that	13
it has a lot	13
way we used to	13
what we were trying	13
plants and we can	13
us in this room	13
i want to have	13
when youre in the	13
i going to do	13
we live in one	13
about the development of	13
then they have to	13
one at a time	13
robots need to be	13
every corner of the	13
was the only one	13
there have been some	13
of these things is	13
part of my life	13
people thought it was	13
all of us when	13
this is a graph	13
it with the same	13
unless we do something	13
in the era of	13
many people here are	13
tell you that there	13
its not the most	13
less than 10 years	13
of billions of dollars	13
and then all of	13
see it with the	13
and learn how to	13
and turn them into	13
able to do so	13
be the end of	13
thats why i think	13
of those people who	13
there is kind of	13
as you may have	13
is the theory of	13
going to leave you	13
do it with the	13
have not been able	13
more work to do	13
to be the last	13
but in fact they	13
we did not know	13
been a little bit	13
what we mean by	13
dont need to be	13
want to know something	13
last year and a	13
at least in theory	13
happening in their own	13
seen many times before	13
any of you have	13
in which were going	13
at this point and	13
i was no longer	13
and taking care of	13
so the next time	13
to see if it	13
so i always like	13
had no choice and	13
dont want to just	13
really good at is	13
and what it does	13
tell them that they	13
once you know how	13
to get it back	13
to do as a	13
first time in history	13
you dont know how	13
its going to get	13
and you can have	13
wrote a letter to	13
the end of our	13
rich and poor is	13
he talked about the	13
to the finish line	13
us to go to	13
we do about this	13
a thousand years ago	13
the end of life	13
ive been working with	13
a source of innovation	13
need to understand that	13
how to fix it	13
them out of the	13
which is going to	13
is not that they	13
one of them i	13
its not an easy	13
i started to feel	13
we got a little	13
the end of his	13
part of my job	13
a little bit lost	13
can do that because	13
want to take the	13
in the brain of	13
there are really two	13
has done a lot	13
so this is actually	13
we apply it to	13
in the far future	13
the lives of people	13
it from the perspective	13
youre going to need	13
reason to believe that	13
to say something about	13
a third of our	13
the really interesting question	13
about the future and	13
and send it to	13
the last year and	13
that there are huge	13
would have had to	13
period of a year	13
that we do and	13
of what were doing	13
if i dont have	13
a person who is	13
we create our own	13
didnt have access to	13
if we could find	13
up the cost of	13
ive got a couple	13
can look at how	13
one day and then	13
about 10 to 20	13
few years ago we	13
so if we can	13
everything that we do	13
if our children are	13
the narrative of a	13
what happened to them	13
the millennium development goals	13
ask questions about how	13
have a responsibility to	13
want to call it	13
let me just say	13
say that there are	13
in world war ii	13
turns out there was	13
the middle of that	13
and thats where i	13
talk about how we	13
what is known as	13
in the next five	13
our responsibility is to	13
to make this a	13
looked at a variety	13
for most of human	13
it would be so	13
around the world i	13
circulation in the world	13
so i said to	13
and i know how	13
surface of the moon	13
were all familiar with	13
in the number of	13
i used to work	13
no idea what we	13
the scale of this	13
around the time of	13
why we need to	13
world in which every	13
in the first instance	13
that in the same	13
in a petri dish	13
to do something a	13
the same as ours	13
and this is very	13
this is known as	13
i dont think theyre	13
i love the idea	13
ill come back to	13
but we all know	13
be able to solve	13
and one thing that	13
to do to you	13
better and better at	13
be really good at	13
there have been many	13
i dont have any	13
being held captive by	13
and in this particular	13
to do what we	13
why we want to	13
times square in new	13
and the last one	13
very small number of	13
different ways that we	13
theres no way that	13
out to be quite	13
some of these people	13
what do you have	13
is that were all	13
so in this case	13
and look out for	13
they grow in the	13
in common is that	13
and over the years	13
a wider range of	13
something that is very	13
we fell in love	13
how do we manage	13
that by the time	13
the first question is	13
in the uk i	13
so over the past	13
to do so i	13
lets take a step	13
as it is to	13
to suggest that the	13
to spend some time	13
lots of things that	13
just solving for x	13
in the traditional sense	13
some of the questions	13
to make a lot	13
of what intelligence is	13
be able to really	13
i think many of	13
could never have imagined	13
to do is make	13
around the same time	13
if we think back	13
look like in a	13
what this tells you	13
of an epic win	13
can see that this	13
dont want to hear	13
is also one of	13
to do away with	13
this tells you is	13
want to do now	13
hard it is to	13
the largest economy in	13
this is a fantastic	13
when we take the	13
to tell us that	13
you compare it to	13
and the sound of	13
a piece of dna	13
in front of our	13
nobel prize for the	13
become more and more	13
when you go home	13
the question is not	13
were starting to see	13
we find that the	13
so i dont have	13
the ability to do	13
there is a huge	13
of the night and	13
if you do not	13
look at how the	13
also figuring out why	13
me when i was	13
of all the things	13
its a place where	13
been thinking about this	13
and i think all	13
go out of our	13
the developing world in	13
in spite of all	13
we have to really	13
was kind of a	13
our universe is not	13
people used to say	13
and i came across	13
all i could think	13
and when you hear	13
up and down in	13
that we are very	13
theyre going to get	13
any length of time	13
thats a big deal	13
in the years that	13
that they are a	13
is all you need	13
a bunch of the	13
things and so the	13
dont know what youre	13
i believe this is	13
us that there are	13
almost twice as much	13
was a chance to	13
that you can find	13
its also figuring out	13
weve been trying to	13
and i talked to	13
turn out to have	13
of work to make	13
the cost of a	13
and the fundamental idea	13
we want to learn	13
so there was no	13
front of you and	13
three out of five	13
that i could do	13
a huge number of	13
to spend the next	13
instead of trying to	13
our sense of self	13
and when this happens	13
of how it works	13
when i got back	13
if you look very	13
into one of these	13
most important thing to	13
so at the end	13
to come to a	13
were the only ones	13
top of each other	13
of the world with	13
way that i was	13
and this meant that	13
that are on the	13
the way we used	13
i would have told	13
the next set of	13
your body and your	13
to figure out which	13
are the size of	13
to go through a	13
you would think that	13
started with a question	13
there is a way	13
about a couple of	13
is not at all	13
the production of new	13
in just a second	13
one thing i know	13
we can get from	13
the question that i	13
i learned that i	13
and let me show	13
and its up to	13
i was a student	13
not just because of	13
thats the first thing	13
and its sort of	13
ive been looking at	13
did a little bit	13
known for a long	13
have some kind of	13
if you were the	13
the building blocks of	13
you should be able	13
the work of a	13
you dont even know	13
different kinds of people	13
they didnt have any	13
it may be a	13
to be known as	13
went up to the	13
deal with all the	13
and i didnt really	13
and this was a	13
it must have been	13
but most of the	13
is being held captive	13
go to the bathroom	13
the intensity of the	13
up in the pacific	13
my people have done	13
mathematics is not just	13
i am one of	13
on this kind of	13
and trying to figure	13
its not a question	13
what youre talking about	13
you just a couple	13
like to call it	13
than the width of	13
and its only by	13
is the thing that	13
what theyre doing to	13
have no access to	13
that were all the	13
that are designed to	13
can be done with	13
out of the jungle	13
life on mars and	13
saw a lot of	13
and most of them	13
because i was the	13
wanted to show you	13
of my life to	13
who am i to	13
i have to start	13
of life and death	13
between good and evil	13
it allows you to	13
time this is a	13
where it gets interesting	13
i want to look	13
if we wanted to	13
this is true of	13
is more like a	13
never been able to	13
in our daily lives	13
for all of our	13
we need to support	13
a confession to make	13
after a lot of	13
in all of our	13
a needle in a	13
and we found one	13
every day and i	13
that were used to	13
so were talking about	13
you can see those	13
and thats the point	13
cant say that i	13
and the world of	13
want you all to	13
were supposed to be	13
for me as a	13
is what we are	13
it doesnt have the	13
the course of a	13
in circulation in the	13
thats not good enough	13
that the technology to	13
to see what we	13
and they will be	13
next generation of the	13
and hard to understand	13
does not have a	13
comes up to me	13
a place that was	13
have the greatest impact	13
some of the best	13
that means that we	13
dont know whats going	13
be surprised to learn	13
makes a lot of	13
were getting to the	13
you feel if you	13
to tell you is	13
was possible to do	13
the course of two	13
i think that theres	13
you that we are	13
it can also be	13
here today to talk	13
time to make a	13
intergovernmental panel on climate	13
the first half of	13
i think about our	13
and i became a	13
do all sorts of	13
could do a lot	13
on the cutting edge	13
you know who you	13
need a lot more	13
its a part of	13
were able to make	13
cant even begin to	13
that was in the	13
that people who have	13
i was told that	13
they do the same	13
so this is really	13
can go back to	13
i dont mean to	13
and look at these	13
wanted to try to	13
what do we call	13
we can see them	13
tell you that story	13
in the lab and	13
i think some of	13
is not just solving	13
which is how we	13
so i ask you	13
in the evolution of	13
like to ask you	13
any kind of a	13
i have a couple	13
this is the work	13
its going to try	13
i know a lot	13
was going to die	13
some of the companies	13
can actually use this	13
of people wanted to	13
meet the needs of	13
i think i have	13
what i was trying	13
not part of the	13
be a lot of	13
we already have a	13
youre like most people	13
going to be good	13
difference in the world	13
this is what youll	13
do we get to	13
some good news for	13
the spinal cord and	13
be willing to share	13
and it still is	13
to say that if	13
us to look at	13
in a universe with	13
something as mundane as	13
keep that in mind	13
see if i can	13
know what they say	13
the kind of society	13
is actually one of	13
can be used as	13
the power and the	13
the picture of a	13
then one day i	13
and we can go	13
believe that the secret	13
you may remember that	13
half million years ago	13
i think im going	13
a nice bit of	13
it at the time	13
a name for it	13
and putting them together	13
and about a year	13
is the use of	13
that were dealing with	13
but i think theres	13
one of his favorite	13
weapons of mass destruction	13
to see what happens	13
now you can take	13
but if you think	13
we can choose to	13
it is very likely	13
and theres a very	13
might be a little	13
group of people who	13
out into the world	13
and in the end	13
to help me with	13
have to try to	13
want to share a	13
at the night sky	13
to a place where	13
fact that in the	13
i started my own	13
of the few places	13
going to get divorced	13
of you have probably	13
and all these things	13
to see if they	13
it one of the	13
the last few months	13
over the place and	13
to look after our	13
were now going to	13
if you were going	13
the time that the	13
and all the way	13
about the people who	13
the human brain and	13
thats why i believe	13
that we dont even	13
of the body and	13
i didnt know it	13
you end up with	13
i dont think you	13
but i would say	13
be a force for	13
change the perception of	13
me while i was	13
we went out to	13
of the laws of	13
we need to consume	13
over 10 years ago	13
to tell me which	13
but i was very	13
so this is another	13
the united states so	13
we can see it	13
does it come from	13
that we do at	13
all of this information	13
for anybody who wants	13
a couple dozen people	13
to protect themselves from	13
we think back to	13
that happens to be	13
lets talk about the	13
we know from the	13
youve got to do	13
of you will remember	13
are as human beings	13
thats why we have	13
first one is that	13
that i did not	13
if youd like to	13
i hope that we	13
is not just that	13
that in the last	13
i realized it was	13
people say things like	13
and we called it	13
the things that were	13
a sense of hope	13
a period of time	13
we wish we had	13
doing this kind of	13
20th century that was	13
dont think we need	13
so if you can	13
i started looking at	13
grew up with the	13
in the country and	13
see it in the	13
when i got the	13
came up with my	13
because i was there	13
going on in that	13
i think about this	13
many of them wont	13
at nine years old	13
was a great idea	13
the body and the	13
that it was possible	13
that enabled us to	13
i realized that there	13
sorts of things and	13
that allow you to	13
what you end up	13
of the story of	13
think for a moment	13
the brain called the	13
to run a marathon	13
little bit of this	13
to what i was	13
is what we see	13
count the number of	13
i want you think	13
and closer and closer	13
so we can get	13
that used to be	13
i tried to get	13
and as we go	13
of five or six	13
so we started with	13
and in my case	13
and in that way	13
tell you what my	13
go back to work	13
with people who are	13
and of course these	13
a story about how	13
felt like i had	13
while i was there	13
and what he meant	13
for a few years	13
city of new york	13
the united states or	13
space and time and	13
want to be in	13
the very act of	13
im going to let	13
brain and the brain	13
have to choose between	13
here is that weve	13
into a kind of	13
was the start of	13
to feel like a	13
theres no doubt that	13
and just as the	13
it over and over	13
square in new york	13
are in the process	13
i think what that	13
and these are not	13
i need to do	13
what we know and	13
the size of this	13
on top of this	13
to the world and	13
we need to reach	13
so that if you	13
force for good in	13
we have been doing	13
but what i am	13
ill leave you with	13
that you can make	13
believe that this is	13
with that kind of	13
the past two decades	13
look at them and	13
not just solving for	13
the problem that we	13
off the face of	13
that goes to the	13
and she was the	13
have to be more	13
that weve been working	13
we need more of	13
so i would like	13
the earth is not	13
want to remind you	13
as you would expect	13
that a little bit	13
still a lot of	13
hell of a lot	13
people in this audience	13
is going to bring	13
is what you do	13
so if we think	13
into the lab and	13
and this would be	13
and its kind of	13
will never be the	13
but what is it	13
people interested in science	13
just take a look	13
this is a completely	13
theres a difference between	13
and then i had	13
than 90 percent of	13
not just a matter	13
a piece of music	13
the important thing to	13
this idea of the	13
great if we could	13
its just that the	13
and thats what were	13
and look for the	13
to be like the	13
because we need to	13
thought it was a	13
the us federal government	13
decided to try to	13
to encourage you to	13
were in a world	13
to ensure that we	13
to get all of	13
has a little bit	13
but look at the	13
the narrative of the	13
a little bit faster	13
in a place where	13
i wanted to ask	13
the tools that we	13
i have no doubt	13
that human beings are	13
under the age of	13
whatever it is that	13
are people who were	13
some people think that	13
would like to make	13
more and more about	13
and i was thinking	13
this is the next	13
not going to stop	13
out of the blue	13
millions of data points	13
terms of being able	13
you feel like youre	13
i have to stay	13
ago when i was	13
the origin of life	13
i came to this	13
can do this we	13
we can also use	13
able to see that	13
area the size of	13
a lot of evidence	13
and invited me to	13
you want them to	13
allows us to do	13
was a group of	13
going to make this	13
and the people that	13
understand whats going on	13
in their own lives	13
youre never going to	13
turned it into a	13
is very simple we	13
to happen and we	13
around the campfire and	13
a number of ways	13
the first thing im	13
come back to it	13
like to introduce you	13
go for a walk	13
they want their own	13
every one of the	13
that we can now	13
robot was able to	13
very much for your	13
was the result of	13
going up and up	13
size of the brain	13
day i went to	13
i used to have	13
there are some people	13
what have we learned	13
the power of this	13
to find out whether	13
just know that i	13
we have all these	13
of what it might	13
the ones who are	13
to break it to	13
physics of your body	13
the world needs now	13
get out of their	13
if we think of	13
us that we are	13
let me say that	13
and so you might	13
you that theyre going	13
now if you think	13
we can make that	13
the only way i	13
to do it its	13
and so i said	13
very difficult to see	13
each other on the	13
go on to the	13
that is kind of	13
what the world needs	13
i was amazed by	13
be able to access	13
was the only way	13
id like to end	13
it is clear that	13
about the things that	13
didnt even know it	13
know where they are	13
to more and more	13
so in the second	13
the core of our	13
an incredible amount of	13
you think about how	13
sense of the world	13
my father was an	13
so even if you	13
and at that moment	13
this is the one	13
millions of years and	13
create a sense of	13
a much bigger problem	13
a long way away	13
as a form of	13
do this we have	13
asked me what i	13
because there was no	13
even as recently as	13
that has to do	13
like to end with	13
to go ahead and	13
perhaps in the future	13
do you do it	13
me say that again	13
i was working in	13
is a very nice	13
other people and to	13
to tell us about	13
have to use your	13
so we created a	13
about it i think	13
were able to come	13
what we wanted to	13
to an area of	13
of people who dont	13
because if we dont	13
you how this works	13
admit that we are	13
so when it comes	13
we all have the	13
and we really dont	13
are so much more	13
an example from my	13
than the sum of	13
dont think you can	13
how is this possible	13
what you are seeing	13
me ask you a	13
take care of their	13
to the first question	13
i hear you ask	13
no choice but to	13
it was a pretty	13
you about some of	13
is that when the	13
me show you a	13
this kind of thinking	13
can see that in	13
had a series of	13
look like in the	13
a few hours and	13
to what is called	13
of a kind of	13
a lot about leadership	13
it makes sense to	13
that i know of	13
but the question is	13
make a big difference	13
it so hard to	13
who live in those	13
and i call it	13
to be honest with	13
the history of our	13
i get to do	13
of what im saying	13
in that moment that	13
up at the top	13
a period of a	13
out to try to	13
says that if you	13
how we can do	13
but a week later	13
didnt believe that they	13
the context of the	13
when i have to	13
we need a lot	13
that over the course	13
put me on the	13
so the question that	13
to take a lot	13
get out of it	13
panel on climate change	13
and we call them	13
now its a little	13
do you find a	13
i think the best	13
it turns out it	13
i live in a	13
and the problem with	13
i wanted to have	13
and i would be	13
and figure out what	13
in which we are	13
a little piece of	13
at the mercy of	13
second part of the	13
the war of independence	13
part of our urban	13
that nobody else is	13
and thats just the	13
to protect us from	13
the first step of	13
the nobel prize in	13
when you have to	13
we want to take	13
we see it as	13
to get anything done	13
you can imagine what	13
im so happy to	13
and three days later	13
of the things weve	13
if there was any	13
all of the above	13
of your body and	13
i think it comes	13
the way we can	13
but the most interesting	13
the complexity of the	13
and he was right	13
those are the three	13
the time that it	13
that every single person	13
that you dont know	13
the greenhouse gas emissions	13
from the surface of	13
are all going to	13
of a sudden i	13
do it with a	13
by a group of	13
didnt know what i	13
the whole world and	13
which is what we	13
with one another and	13
if youre like most	13
the nice thing about	13
and i was working	13
better than any other	13
first half of the	13
that the amount of	13
that you cant have	13
and im just going	13
think about what is	13
going to give it	13
that we had this	13
looked at me as	13
times the mass of	13
we as a species	13
in five years time	13
means that if you	13
the real thing so	13
set out to do	13
from one place to	13
that would give us	13
out in the world	13
want you to imagine	13
figure out what to	13
theres a very small	13
to a very different	13
the smell of the	13
in front of him	13
its not that hard	13
you do with your	13
which were going to	13
the physics of your	13
you to join the	13
more and more useful	13
the next question is	13
what i have to	13
we have to move	13
what we think is	13
and those are the	13
the size of our	13
of the time the	13
the verge of an	13
i have an interest	13
think about the world	13
not talking about the	13
we have shown that	13
the mother of invention	13
i was a teenager	13
thing that you can	13
the physical world and	13
made in the same	13
one of the causes	13
and then it was	13
i decided to study	13
we didnt know what	13
we want to improve	13
i think you would	13
that so im going	13
this isnt going to	13
that were familiar with	13
it ought to be	13
you can tell a	13
you and me and	13
know that we are	13
and whats interesting is	13
any place in the	13
use this as a	13
i gave you a	13
if you ask the	13
i thought that i	13
is some kind of	13
of women who were	13
of the body so	13
out of work and	13
so if you know	13
how you think about	13
the right amount of	13
they want to get	13
need to remember that	13
i think we will	13
thing to notice is	13
if you put a	13
me it was a	13
you can use to	13
supposed to be a	13
and that was that	13
think that there is	13
of people in a	13
after a few years	13
bring out the best	13
youre going to send	13
because we wanted to	13
we will see it	12
press and a free	12
the world is stuck	12
im now going to	12
tell you about how	12
so when one ant	12
makes us all the	12
some of the images	12
that there are only	12
theres a kind of	12
is much bigger than	12
like i have to	12
intention of putting princess	12
tell you two stories	12
the world is going	12
the brain in order	12
and i try to	12
the risk of concussion	12
i knew i would	12
on this planet we	12
a story of a	12
think of it like	12
is you want to	12
came to realize that	12
happens all the time	12
the gospel of doubt	12
and its a really	12
millions of years of	12
boosting your four types	12
just think of the	12
terms of how the	12
us to take a	12
to me and he	12
my country and my	12
learned how to love	12
dark matter and dark	12
amira and her family	12
for the fact that	12
kilometer tunnel or a	12
that is in the	12
would not be here	12
not to believe it	12
or getting out of	12
million dollars a year	12
is also known as	12
of the most interesting	12
the present and the	12
have to be pretty	12
multiple points of view	12
we see when we	12
of the characters is	12
to stay away from	12
in the emerging markets	12
the unreasonable effectiveness of	12
to say this is	12
of the press and	12
what does that look	12
but a fully complex	12
it is normal when	12
it was like a	12
is just one example	12
is the problem and	12
liquid water on the	12
to make sure its	12
able to have a	12
the error will be	12
who worked at the	12
in the northern hemisphere	12
and my dad said	12
explain a little bit	12
time enough to iron	12
require a lot of	12
we look at all	12
i walked into a	12
that we want and	12
the two strands of	12
i showed you earlier	12
that even the best	12
do i agree with	12
never do this as	12
in the flys brain	12
black and brown child	12
and tell you about	12
i have to go	12
there are other ways	12
than the other and	12
found that we can	12
show you what that	12
little tomboy in her	12
imagine that youre a	12
if you were in	12
when we have the	12
am not ready for	12
dont even have a	12
lag behind the skull	12
the front of your	12
to the spinal cord	12
can still be the	12
know that as you	12
sorry to hear that	12
really have to ask	12
people have been living	12
top of the pyramid	12
you to be able	12
so much for that	12
000 people a day	12
so what im doing	12
i think it will	12
a good brain theory	12
and i give them	12
is this is the	12
important thing to do	12
i have so much	12
with just a few	12
that for thousands of	12
the form of carbon	12
learn a lot from	12
a minute or two	12
possible not to believe	12
to be happy and	12
water splashes at lower	12
those people in the	12
of the words we	12
if you know about	12
you think about this	12
the universe is made	12
this is a network	12
to get it to	12
its almost as if	12
hang on to them	12
and weve done a	12
also be used to	12
so far as to	12
that is a huge	12
havent yet gone to	12
the answer to this	12
wasnt supposed to have	12
all familiar with the	12
how well are we	12
a combination of genes	12
and see if you	12
do it is to	12
you to pay attention	12
so its understandable that	12
facial blood flow on	12
be warm enough for	12
bees have access to	12
and what did it	12
over time on the	12
this would be an	12
few packets of seeds	12
i do a lot	12
is the one who	12
event of an accident	12
and if that is	12
10 years ago we	12
hundreds of hours of	12
of which there are	12
the planet mars and	12
can do anything you	12
and i think when	12
good place to start	12
and that kept us	12
in the second flight	12
be part of that	12
the heart of this	12
enough to iron your	12
of this is a	12
and this brings me	12
a very simple way	12
genes that can cause	12
find my way back	12
i know you know	12
thousands of people have	12
world a little bit	12
here so you can	12
no idea what was	12
have to be in	12
there are more people	12
and putting it back	12
a network designed to	12
who grew up in	12
and then the really	12
what i was going	12
id like to finish	12
all i ever had	12
places for us to	12
of girls and women	12
and that brings me	12
to do that but	12
i think is the	12
my research focuses on	12
few of us have	12
of the periodic table	12
and ill never forget	12
and as it turns	12
about the role of	12
im not sure if	12
to be nice to	12
how is that possible	12
on no matter what	12
the opportunity to do	12
regrets of the dying	12
ought to wash their	12
has been a huge	12
lot of people and	12
to be this is	12
is the power of	12
to move around the	12
voted to leave the	12
thinking about little girls	12
the matter is that	12
are going on in	12
there was so much	12
all of us need	12
into the pollen and	12
a day or two	12
this allows us to	12
dont know what i	12
brain and the left	12
and its not fair	12
if it wasnt for	12
all of this in	12
in the middle there	12
is getting greater and	12
and the reason we	12
the way to do	12
within a couple of	12
its a symbol of	12
as a tool for	12
its not enough just	12
can they detect childrens	12
to iron your cape	12
them we have to	12
be the global sheriff	12
and i still dont	12
be the architect of	12
that we all share	12
strong and smart and	12
that the majority of	12
something out of nothing	12
break it to you	12
in the dark and	12
in the streets of	12
to expand our range	12
what we try to	12
we think about a	12
for us to see	12
when i was 12	12
when i was 15	12
the position of the	12
slow the head down	12
back to the skies	12
the next step in	12
for much of the	12
the press and a	12
i spend most of	12
across all of the	12
a lot to be	12
every time you see	12
the amazing thing about	12
the same as it	12
open your eyes now	12
if you could take	12
about they control the	12
four orders of magnitude	12
queer and trans people	12
in a grocery store	12
when youre struck and	12
and we hope to	12
have to go through	12
experience of that force	12
stand up in front	12
it had to do	12
to meet the demands	12
we think that the	12
what they do they	12
means is that when	12
ready for a driverless	12
dont really know that	12
going to do some	12
do with all of	12
that will enable us	12
cause all i ever	12
all the time you	12
you look back at	12
but speak to your	12
one of those kids	12
bee to have a	12
the difference between these	12
study has shown that	12
we could use to	12
if the soil doesnt	12
fossil fuels in order	12
that might be the	12
you dont see a	12
most experts think that	12
bottom of the pyramid	12
i try to explain	12
they are the most	12
is normal when a	12
it seems that even	12
when things start to	12
its a very small	12
a deck of cards	12
it feels like when	12
to the skies for	12
princess leia merchandise in	12
a few years earlier	12
all in this together	12
so there are two	12
and over again to	12
and not drill in	12
thats the result of	12
attracts a lot of	12
is strong and smart	12
that if you give	12
day after day after	12
have spent the past	12
first thing i did	12
dont think they are	12
then we have the	12
on your next vacation	12
if we had a	12
getting more and more	12
we do have to	12
if there was an	12
found that people who	12
we have to talk	12
other people to know	12
child number two is	12
that had to be	12
still find no new	12

it is in our	12

car in front of	12
there was actually a	12

thinking about the things	12
going to respond to	12
when i found myself	12
what happens if you	12
you get sensory feedback	12
you can see if	12
the world a better	12
how it is that	12
a good friend of	12

i want you all	12
what percentage of the	12
nobody else in the	12
a good thing i	12
i asked you to	12
with the human body	12
it was not comfortable	12
build a society without	12
taken out of the	12
we made an oil	12
why didnt you just	12
send it to the	12
i started a company	12
im really interested in	12
in the world was	12
you know what that	12
today we would call	12
as the forest grows	12
begin to see the	12
kind of love that	12
and if i stutter	12
or a small group	12
farmers become more productive	12
you have the ability	12
ill show you how	12
given the opportunity to	12
almost the speed of	12
i want to remind	12
of a human that	12
what on earth is	12

down a little bit	12

for the oldest books	12
in the quantum world	12
splashes at lower octave	12
of the things about	12
im a big fan	12
of the worlds refugees	12
long will it take	12
and as you see	12
the blink of an	12
the days when you	12
and they will make	12
in my work was	12
me that i should	12
want to introduce you	12
take out your phones	12
the sounds of the	12
if i stutter along	12
men and women in	12
that the world has	12
compare it to the	12
of which is that	12
it look like to	12
it for a minute	12
plant and gets into	12
you just want to	12
so its not at	12
in the future it	12
the allen telescope array	12
and just to give	12
and working in the	12
remember the experience of	12
tell you that it	12
call it what it	12
we search at higher	12
going to be great	12
for any kind of	12
the 80s and 90s	12
the two of them	12
fuels in order to	12
to tell me that	12
in the neural network	12
what we saw is	12
some of his arguments	12
is what we have	12
has enabled us to	12
the first time it	12
a little bit closer	12
but what you see	12
bring people into the	12
lot of information about	12
if youve ever had	12
is the equivalent of	12
the emergence of a	12
easily detect their lies	12
short space of time	12
me take you back	12
if the answer is	12
order to generate all	12
that is used for	12
then we will look	12
that youre seeing on	12
and if there is	12
very important part of	12
and the lives of	12
mirrors in this telescope	12
how the brain functions	12
think about it i	12
all sorts of different	12
the skies for you	12
that they might be	12
lot of ways to	12
is in our dna	12
for most of the	12
were being turned into	12
to be good or	12
the next year or	12
of new brain cells	12
hard to get a	12
i worked as a	12
can make changes to	12
you send a command	12
than the number of	12
many times have you	12
for a moment what	12
tiny fraction of the	12
the next part of	12
is the face of	12
if i can do	12
even want to think	12
when i showed up	12
thats a lot more	12
if you go there	12
seek asylum in europe	12
taken off the app	12
this is the perfect	12
we ever want to	12
im sure we all	12
to move through the	12
ill marry when i	12
when you listen to	12
its not that easy	12
of all the different	12
and my hope is	12
will be better off	12
number of neurons in	12
the event of an	12
have our masculinity to	12
as a tool of	12
we think of it	12
im just telling you	12
want people to know	12
were not there yet	12
i decided to take	12
jean king leadership initiative	12
and weve been doing	12
what would you attempt	12
to get on the	12
im still a skeptical	12
this robot is now	12
were a long way	12
to give this one	12
first step is to	12
in a community like	12
youve probably heard about	12
in their man cave	12
like so many other	12
theyre going to actually	12
the waste from the	12
is that he was	12
to introduce technology to	12
but all of the	12
was taken over by	12
thats really going to	12
the special quantum properties	12
back to that original	12
leia merchandise in the	12
it is that its	12
oldest books in the	12
substances in your body	12
for this generation to	12
of ones and zeros	12
on the right end	12
order to get a	12
up with my own	12
that looks like this	12
scale to meet the	12
that we do not	12
which is a protein	12
i would be able	12
think we all know	12
they could do it	12
like to a bee	12
fights like a ninja	12
i didnt discover a	12
forest in the backyard	12
half a trillion dollars	12
as we did this	12
the experience of that	12
will no longer be	12
with one of these	12
computers around the world	12
someone like me could	12
if all of the	12
tell you something about	12
made the decision to	12
we leave the room	12
had all of these	12
laying down memories of	12
and its a great	12
their lives and the	12
time when i was	12
of my talk today	12
i am so excited	12
come back in a	12
world this is the	12
might be the case	12
30 years from now	12
that we call the	12
have a pakistani accent	12
highest numbers of immigrants	12
expansion of the universe	12
a lot about this	12
to close with a	12
looking at the data	12
perhaps one of the	12
in my life where	12
my back and a	12
this is an interesting	12
spent much of my	12
and the cities that	12
two sources of information	12
the first couple of	12
we do all of	12
on the rooftop of	12
in the family and	12
and the nature of	12
here we want to	12
do right now is	12
researchers planted the false	12
that i have a	12
and of course its	12
what we need in	12
were about to embark	12
of the water and	12
i would have had	12
and there are so	12
years ago we started	12
interact together to make	12
to apply the same	12
i would read about	12
had to make a	12
billie jean king leadership	12
about six months ago	12
is to build a	12
smile on my face	12
that concordance rate is	12
genes causing autism in	12
fast and fights like	12
the answer to a	12
and what bayes rule	12
face as a guide	12
the same set of	12
hole in the ground	12
in the muslim world	12
a look at a	12
look out into the	12
a little less than	12
that when you were	12
and see if we	12
to do the voice	12
theres another source of	12
a study on the	12
and back to the	12
to see how well	12
to keep up with	12

when you get a	12
the hedge fund industry	12
of the sound of	12
to have to live	12
more likely to do	12
that well be able	12
within the reach of	12
have been the most	12
we can figure out	12
working memory is that	12
we can ask whether	12
development without fossil fuels	12
feel that they are	12
we knew we had	12
speed of the human	12
the world have been	12
the energy of the	12
the same intrauterine environment	12
to understand where the	12
but there are still	12
of our individual actions	12
attempt to do if	12
tells us that we	12
the fact that she	12
before we get started	12
is a better way	12
we have the same	12
about it in the	12
this is a guy	12
is how do we	12
mott hall bridges academy	12
on when i showed	12
the father and the	12
what its doing is	12
we are used to	12
tell you when you	12
and he was a	12
to respond to this	12
spreading all over the	12
having a low floor	12
of the male sex	12
time thinking about little	12
the other half of	12
really know that much	12
and so it is	12
a little bit further	12
the history of introspection	12
the next 100 years	12
now take a step	12
production of new neurons	12
you went to the	12
its just going to	12
i could give you	12
that even in the	12
people who might be	12
if no one marries	12
people to know that	12
that vaccines cause autism	12
that led to the	12
make predictions of the	12
going to see just	12
of the world it	12
you can put it	12
point of view of	12
and then they come	12
is based on a	12
we are expanding the	12
i think were sort	12
wed like to do	12
network designed to recognize	12
they fit together in	12
it was about the	12
for us is that	12
a threat to the	12
should we care about	12
thirty percent a year	12
for each of us	12
not a good idea	12
a woman who was	12
can imagine something similar	12
but it can also	12
used to manufacture many	12
we want to go	12
in love with that	12
a skeptical little kid	12
the atlantic to the	12
can do all kinds	12
its an issue for	12
want to have to	12
back in the day	12
but its not like	12
of my life in	12
of the developed world	12
and i watched the	12
to point out that	12
look at it and	12
way that it works	12
it looks like in	12
so many of you	12
side of the equation	12
go out and do	12
not good at life	12
one of the women	12
y is the unknown	12
that you are a	12
the problems of the	12
also allowed us to	12
so thats what were	12
that the number one	12
that we face in	12
i know that its	12
even know where to	12
where things are going	12
and put it on	12
the capacity of the	12
have a long way	12
new era of trust	12
we can do all	12
so why is this	12
if you knew you	12
at that point in	12
out of their way	12
were not just talking	12
to pick up the	12
we still find no	12
get a handle on	12
to be infallible truth	12
around the world also	12
be the most important	12
the lives of millions	12
i could have ever	12
the long axis of	12
have to be this	12
and when i went	12
an l and an	12
learn what we know	12
that is not a	12
how long will it	12
ill tell you the	12
the next hundred years	12
the reach of every	12
at five years old	12
you may have a	12
dont really understand it	12
is going to succeed	12
the same type of	12
is not my home	12
the west coast of	12
up with a new	12
down memories of childhood	12
this will be a	12
of people from the	12
so you get the	12
that no one else	12
have shown that the	12
know what that is	12
we use it to	12
same diagnosis of autism	12
ill just give you	12
in three dimensions of	12
to think that we	12
to do it now	12
the same thing now	12
how to make the	12
but im here to	12
actually going to be	12
much more than just	12
get in the way	12
about to whip somebodys	12
you are seeing here	12
a little paper me	12
they know how to	12
can you hear me	12
and here is some	12
doesnt mean that we	12
on the same day	12
to the left of	12
were all kind of	12
that many of the	12
maybe they should be	12
she has friends like	12
and the left brain	12
and the things that	12
imagine you are a	12
more people in the	12
at the museum of	12
of the black and	12
can change the way	12
i think it has	12
along the outsides of	12
and he wanted to	12
that it doesnt have	12
way to look at	12
can i do for	12
to see what the	12
green and blue and	12
friends and the stranger	12
us a little bit	12
the end of every	12
of it is that	12
just as important as	12
i would never do	12
that i think the	12
you what it is	12
does not have the	12
it is actually a	12
at the united nations	12
lose a lot of	12
to the other forces	12
wanted to do so	12
new type of agriculture	12
next year or two	12
blood flow on the	12
actually a lot of	12
can do things like	12
suffering as a necessary	12
its a bit like	12
you dont need a	12
its not easy to	12
is on the verge	12
the other forces of	12
fit together in a	12
want to start with	12
going to have the	12
tell you about two	12
struck in the head	12
year in the us	12
i wrote a book	12
people can hang on	12
the developing world is	12
here on earth and	12
all over the globe	12
you dont understand it	12
then be captured by	12
it has all the	12
became very relevant in	12
is kind of cool	12
that doesnt have a	12
causing autism in those	12
best way to do	12
a negative impact on	12
and you begin to	12
it felt like i	12
before the age of	12
a picture like this	12
of these new neurons	12
to spend 15 years	12
i said earlier that	12
a thick layer of	12
there are no experts	12
is going to grow	12
the whole world is	12
machine learning can do	12
at about the same	12
then we ask whether	12
because were in a	12
the challenges of the	12
me and a little	12
you can take that	12
the time when i	12
we do the opposite	12
that i could not	12
what happened when we	12
about the origin of	12
30 in the morning	12
been trying to do	12
sitting in front of	12
the ancient greek tradition	12
i realized that my	12
how could we even	12
its going to do	12
if you look closely	12
one of my great	12
that they use to	12
a particular kind of	12
an area the size	12
would never want to	12
what is your name	12
now working memory capacity	12
the left of the	12
the world that is	12
be more likely to	12
reach of every one	12
it on top of	12
it just so happens	12
know that most of	12
got to go back	12
how do you think	12
of the industrial revolution	12
of view at once	12
the computer in the	12
necessarily just a camera	12
its one thing to	12
as a guest on	12
is a serious problem	12
an al qaeda in	12
and for the last	12
has sensors in it	12
this is a time	12
not necessarily just a	12
as we like to	12
do what you can	12
changed my life and	12
want to do as	12
make eye contact with	12
it becomes more ticklish	12
will increase the production	12
have been living there	12
those extra sdrs that	12
in the state of	12
can tell us something	12
to think of intelligence	12
lesson that we learned	12
we know this because	12
what machine learning can	12
a waste of time	12
i would not be	12
not even going to	12
somewhere in the world	12
and they may not	12
and were making it	12
percent goes in their	12
to be accountable for	12
the joy of voting	12
look at what happens	12
that as long as	12
to have a new	12
be willing to do	12
merchandise in the store	12
to close your eyes	12
the fact that our	12
the biggest problem that	12
this is used in	12
a renewable source of	12
the milky way galaxy	12
into a world of	12
and that is to	12
the light of day	12
this is the future	12
would like to ask	12
of this is to	12
aerodynamic control of the	12
we all agree shouldnt	12
portions of the trajectory	12
you can just see	12
the right end of	12
we can do more	12
story and i think	12
think about it here	12
in search of a	12
of the gay agenda	12
grew out of the	12
the heat of the	12
i sat down to	12
a little tomboy in	12
cape and back to	12
your cape and back	12
on the planet is	12
in that process we	12
the european union but	12
we ran it again	12
americans dont want to	12
my claim is that	12
twins that actually share	12
top five regrets of	12
but im not sure	12
multiple and interacting causes	12
a story about this	12
i have a daughter	12
id like to ask	12
than it is to	12
dont know why some	12
so what kind of	12
work very well for	12
what we would find	12
to the disney store	12
of the year in	12
flowering plants that bees	12
and it wasnt just	12
going to need a	12
the three friends and	12
other part of the	12
would then be captured	12
have a good brain	12
and if were lucky	12
end of the cold	12
the width of the	12
sick and tired of	12
but theres actually a	12
their pigs noses and	12
back and forward and	12
and so in fact	12
this has to be	12
to make a forest	12
why should you care	12
i felt it was	12
minutes of bonus life	12
i can hold my	12
we can see its	12
we can create our	12
were being watched at	12
thousands of times and	12
to address the concerns	12
the ability of the	12
make ourselves feel better	12
i go to a	12
was like to be	12
control of the vehicle	12
to the very same	12
a bee to have	12
neurons in the hippocampus	12
is only time enough	12
my life in the	12
were going to represent	12
it was more than	12
generate all our electricity	12
id like to introduce	12
what were seeing now	12
and i have learned	12
if you enjoy a	12
was trying to figure	12
before we get to	12
and the man said	12
one way is to	12
the last year or	12
am i looking for	12
it is possible the	12
would invest in a	12
from a working memory	12
could be warm enough	12
some of these ideas	12
only three dimensions of	12
take a trust leap	12
she is just trying	12
decided to do a	12
keep track of the	12
and fights like a	12
corner of the world	12
when farmers become more	12
brought to you by	12
three to four hours	12
we landed on the	12
if you think child	12
the site of the	12
but you dont need	12
society without fossil fuels	12
impact on the climate	12
a certain number of	12
cheerleader of global values	12
not drill in the	12
other forces of nature	12
billion people on the	12
come to the table	12
to be open to	12
time in american history	12
organizations in the world	12
is one of them	12
imagine something similar to	12
in the future by	12
particles of light and	12
the country right now	12
in a very large	12
i was talking about	12
more often than not	12
the sensory consequences and	12
well are we doing	12
and i feel like	12
to better understand the	12
two hours in the	12
to listen to the	12
been on this planet	12
a couple weeks ago	12
to take a different	12
she wasnt on it	12
first time in human	12
is so powerful that	12
planted the false memory	12
you can have an	12
what would that look	12
this is actually the	12
so i quit my	12
back and look at	12
three minutes of fully	12
sending out an sos	12
examples of how technology	12
i dont think the	12
and if you havent	12
we could make a	12
the best thing i	12
loops by repeating that	12
across the atlantic ocean	12
and then you just	12
i would tell you	12
and a free and	12
strategic and financial acumen	12
spread because we found	12
all agree shouldnt have	12
money selling princesses to	12
this is all a	12
protect the lives of	12
i do what i	12
heres what you need	12
treat it like a	12
that so this is	12
so we ended up	12
that i think that	12
that the most important	12
our masculinity to prove	12
one of them you	12
has a unique sound	12
this one is a	12
like many of you	12
and that means we	12
the best place in	12
the extent of the	12
fundamental idea is you	12
run out of time	12
for the sum of	12
just come out of	12
the probability of different	12
at each other and	12
like this one and	12
of time in this	12
the combination of all	12
may believe in the	12
defy the impossible and	12
the center of our	12
and at the bottom	12
if you wanted a	12
if we can see	12
no one marries me	12
i was faced with	12
a system like this	12
hearts and minds to	12
on its way to	12
struck and your head	12
when i was on	12
plan for the future	12
dont have our masculinity	12
feels like to a	12
had to interrogate masculinity	12
man of my own	12
the highest rates of	12
going to use it	12
little bit of that	12
to be afraid of	12
maybe some of you	12
but it was just	12
to ask and answer	12
be able to show	12
with all of that	12
in the air but	12
the story about the	12
are going to need	12
theyre never going to	12
so i thought to	12
ability to change your	12
lose faith in the	12
into what i call	12
to tell you something	12
such a system would	12
those data points to	12
might just be the	12
i had in my	12
due to the fact	12
does any other emotion	12
and that made me	12
we have to worry	12
chk chk chk chk	12
turns out that today	12
were going to solve	12
another source of information	12
11 minutes and 20	12
that allows you to	12
to walk up the	12
the working of the	12
thats the way it	12
me all the time	12
l and an o	12
get an idea of	12
is that the human	12
that makes us all	12
never be the same	12
who was one of	12
and to my surprise	12
to manufacture many products	12
the current climate of	12
need to be aware	12
and they wanted to	12
and put them in	12
of the world have	12
percent of the vote	12
can come together and	12
the whole idea of	12
and some of these	12
was the cost of	12
to speak to the	12
turns out that its	12
inside the head of	12
to be ashamed of	12
the only political party	12
guys are going to	12
a young man who	12
in a state of	12
the same sort of	12
world this is a	12
in the entire world	12
all of these interactions	12
abolition of fossil fuels	12
big enough to get	12
that the brains of	12
like this can really	12
talk about what we	12
can you imagine if	12
you can imagine something	12
many people as possible	12
speak as much as	12
how technology is creating	12
to osama bin laden	12
who happened to be	12
rushing through the brain	12
to establish trust and	12
is at the heart	12
we see it with	12
to do anything about	12
a better job of	12
five regrets of the	12
a scientist at mit	12
there must be a	12
to tell you one	12
that there are a	12
can go on your	12
the world today is	12
through the solar system	12
and this is happening	12
the people of the	12
you can get the	12
woman in the world	12
learn this through the	12
the highest numbers of	12
an immense shock for	12
to the global economy	12
i am so grateful	12
of times per second	12
or to help them	12
out of the bottom	12
its a combination of	12
so they dont want	12
they detect childrens lies	12
over billions of years	12
to me in the	12
states digital service is	12
to believe that there	12
in some of these	12
because they thought that	12
how to play a	12
or in some cases	12
the facial blood flow	12
here are just a	12
the words we say	12
so in the first	12
address the concerns of	12
we dont know that	12
part of a team	12
learn a lot about	12
so where are we	12
in that part of	12
the empire state building	12
ill tell you why	12
a variety of ways	12
turn it into the	12
id just like to	12
even though they were	12
they were being watched	12
and using this technology	12
theyre all over the	12
bears bowl is too	12
make sure that these	12
i think its going	12
the amount of information	12
the place where the	12
like it was recorded	12
and smart and fast	12
you an example from	12
now this is the	12
perhaps then we will	12
this is the actual	12
and its been a	12
if youre in the	12
present and the future	12
to be a pretty	12
we can zoom in	12
five million years ago	12
world is stuck with	12
has a number of	12
we try to tackle	12
how well were doing	12
amount of water they	12
been living there for	12
for a long period	12
all the time they	12
as to how to	12
an amazing amount of	12
such thing as silence	12
how long it took	12
and now lets compare	12
thing that we have	12
when they see this	12
you who i am	12
weve been talking about	12
and i know its	12
will see it in	12
would it be like	12
im playing around with	12
and it made me	12
ive just shown you	12
were trying to get	12
the world is in	12
this is from the	12
not that easy to	12
we look at our	12
of the statue of	12
and i promise you	12
half of the videos	12
on renewable energy and	12
and they did it	12
and the future of	12
become a natural resource	12
for the other half	12
the time of conception	12
that we have these	12
and that number is	12
of putting princess leia	12
how on earth do	12
to go to university	12
that you can actually	12
with this video is	12
you have in the	12
of the world would	12
still a skeptical little	12
we have they can	12
an internal combustion engine	12
to say that they	12
what we have today	12
to share one more	12
little paper me and	12
of the earth and	12
on my first day	12
was thought to be	12
what is going to	12
this leads me to	12
how did this happen	12
a situation like this	12
but theres another source	12
more likely to take	12
gives us a unique	12
the process of the	12
tell us about the	12
palm oil is used	12
the cutting edge of	12
have the technology to	12
some things that are	12
rest of the body	12
long did it take	12
understand what was going	12
we were really excited	12
use my voice in	12
a better life for	12
means you have to	12
people would be willing	12
a few of us	12
really do believe that	12
out of the box	12
getting to mars is	12
what i hope you	12
we learn what we	12
child number one is	12
do you realize that	12
if i have a	12
exaggeration to say that	12
had his account deactivated	12
didnt discover a particle	12
show you some of	12
the order of a	12
to go beyond the	12
the giant magellan telescope	12
of the greatest challenges	12
the moment of truth	12
and youre able to	12
the oldest books in	12
i had this idea	12
two years of age	12
were entering a new	12
amount of information that	12
i got a phone	12
going to get wet	12
on the west coast	12
fossil fuels for good	12
time to go to	12
coming back to a	12
we can see is	12
and so i would	12
of the same species	12
to use my voice	12
jennings announce the new	12
who they are and	12
preexisting notion of normal	12
the mountain of debts	12
but i was also	12
in the cerebral cortex	12
you want to liberate	12
to be the global	12
no intention of putting	12
and it was amazing	12
the fundamental idea is	12
rather than trying to	12
two to three years	12
the last time i	12
do if you knew	12
your head rotates in	12
all of this because	12
allows us to see	12
started to think about	12
because we might be	12
but they dont have	12
and they can be	12
perception and creativity are	12
they ought to wash	12
trying to do in	12
a man who is	12
i had grown up	12
that were inside the	12
not just going to	12
the secret to this	12
we werent able to	12
the comments on the	12
and as a young	12
the cheerleader of global	12
try to understand what	12
selling princesses to girls	12
way of saying that	12
doing something like this	12
are you talking about	12
which is what the	12
has never seen a	12
you can call it	12
so powerful that it	12
all of you in	12
the beauty of the	12
thats the end of	12
and i see a	12
means to be human	12
form of carbon dioxide	12
bayes rule says is	12
a lot of smart	12
is that its an	12
the person in the	12
is the engine of	12
that they were actually	12
we dont really have	12
to generate all our	12
we see around us	12
can see some of	12
we want them to	12
and what they do	12
if you give a	12
so much as a	12
what we started to	12
a group of journalists	12
of my own house	12
i come back to	12
000 messages between us	12
we wont be able	12
seems to me to	12
the fear of failure	12
the university of pennsylvania	12
for them to get	12
youre in the middle	12
how trust is built	12
percent of american media	12
example from my own	12
can make millions of	12
the international monetary fund	12
and when i came	12
most of human history	12
if you have any	12
the skull and then	12
can do is to	12
attitudes in the united	12
to be associated with	12
think that if we	12
the next 30 years	12
comments on the video	12
various hidden emotions and	12
it would work in	12
heres an image of	12
own face as a	12
fact that there is	12
so as to minimize	12
of each of these	12
when you get home	12
i knew nothing about	12
i can do that	12
do you see the	12
actually kind of a	12
to a bee to	12
the things that is	12
going to be on	12
can see that we	12
strands of magnetic field	12
we wouldnt be able	12
10 years from now	12
was struck in the	12
im sorry to hear	12
there is no reason	12
many of you might	12
brain areas that respond	12
because they are so	12
this is a photo	12
working on for the	12
i could go on	12
is a problem in	12
i am not ready	12
to explain to the	12
the black and brown	12
if we do not	12
of people out there	12
think about it is	12
if we could mobilize	12
or not they are	12
the universe and the	12
show you how this	12
this is a cross	12
and a sense of	12
off the app store	12
think what that means	12
to the surface of	12
the fate of the	12
the corporate gun lobby	12
backyard of my own	12
to have a good	12
understand that there are	12
different point of view	12
the living human brain	12
this is exactly the	12
you were to go	12
dont we have the	12
going to go over	12
a picture of birds	12
has a role to	12
know that we have	12
of it and the	12
all kinds of different	12
has been around for	12
if this is true	12
people in your life	12
and it doesnt work	12
but i think thats	12
they go to work	12
you can make it	12
there might be other	12
the exact opposite of	12
we get in the	12
to see if i	12
a piece of the	12
now lets look at	12
was able to go	12
in the ancient greek	12
have to make that	12
i think the first	12
and we have not	12
come back to my	12
that if you can	12
my family and i	12
than it is in	12
like this is the	12
vibrate in different patterns	12
so i invite all	12
that most of you	12
where you can see	12
the brain and so	12
renewable source of power	12
the third thing that	12
i know something about	12
we have managed to	12
you give me a	12
95 percent of their	12
in the event that	12
be nice to you	12
no matter how far	12
as it might sound	12
because what it means	12
and what i realized	12
also happens to be	12
used to be one	12
real estate in the	12
things that we see	12
move the same way	12
points of view at	12
an epic win is	12
would that look like	12
that can be defined	12
a product of microbes	12
paper me and a	12
wish i could have	12
about who we are	12
is nothing like a	12
to 100 percent of	12
the first step in	12
look back at earth	12
to you about a	12
the world is to	12
be able to answer	12
on the development of	12
away the waste from	12
who is one of	12
the way we communicate	12
so here are the	12
of color in stem	12
the total amount of	12
manufactured using palm oil	12
the united states it	12
it was easy to	12
trying to be nice	12
other people the way	12
i happen to be	12
the lives of astronauts	12
of information about the	12
we know about the	12
to be really good	12
changes over time on	12
quite a long time	12
and a little paper	12
its about the size	12
we need to process	12
percent of girls and	12
to think about a	12
in for all those	12
am so excited to	12
get to the grocery	12
search at higher energies	12
closer to the concept	12
they are the ones	12
about the things they	12
at the mit media	12
because there are many	12
a man who was	12
to whip somebodys ass	12
and now you can	12
so this is just	12
tell you what i	12
if you dont want	12
do you see here	12
me show you the	12
would you attempt to	12
just dont have our	12
the gamers of foldit	12
pieces back together again	12
bees in the world	12
for a total of	12
my work was a	12
probably the biggest problem	12
in the audience who	12
it would be nice	12
of your life and	12
passing in front of	12
the time he was	12
amazing things stop happening	12
you were born in	12
there a long time	12
the only person in	12
and it doesnt just	12
the only ones that	12
90 percent of american	12
another part of the	12
tell you that that	12
the void of death	12
sustainably scale to meet	12
an idea of the	12
a community of folks	12
last couple of days	12
destined to be unanswered	12
to talk about how	12
who lives in the	12
magical place called darpa	12
those genes causing autism	12
why dont you come	12
the last 16 months	12
and thats why im	12
as you see in	12
are very close to	12
trying to find the	12
more than 80 percent	12
the americans dont want	12
that we have they	12
going to do next	12
use personal dna machines	12
was recorded inside a	12
you its going to	12
be nice to nerds	12
how happy they were	12
and fast and fights	12
give me a break	12
per acre per year	12
that there is not	12
show you the first	12
miles away from the	12
but you can look	12
in impossible things and	12
i think is important	12
fed up with the	12
there is no one	12
live in three dimensions	12
we start to see	12
that if i was	12
you knew you could	12
a long way from	12
that it had to	12
well the answer is	12
a bit like we	12
to me and say	12
what does this tell	12
so that when we	12
so i thought that	12
to take into account	12
get caught up in	12
could we put it	12
it was recorded inside	12
in the exact same	12
i want to read	12
to make that color	12
the billie jean king	12
memory that when you	12
that it looks like	12
the way i did	12
had to be made	12
think that we should	12
scale to meet that	12
little bit about where	12
what you do when	12
the first line of	12
and first of all	12
these types of technologies	12
few years ago when	12
have a sense that	12
about a hundred times	12
was going on with	12
of the time but	12
know what i would	12
is our ability to	12
we still have a	12
can use that to	12
a necessary act of	12
all the other people	12
there are other planets	12
back and forth between	12
find that it was	12
so what were going	12
have to solve a	12
the image of the	12
this for the first	12
people who seem to	12
miles away and it	12
in an attempt to	12
i know a little	12
can see this is	12
increase the production of	12
is one of these	12
it up in the	12
i began to ask	12
me since i was	12
after day after day	12
you think child number	12
was a sense of	12
and try to see	12
fly faster than the	12
of other people and	12
the cities that we	12
what bayes rule says	12
theyre going to produce	12
that you dont want	12
agency over their learning	12
what does brexit represent	12
the age of reason	12
wanted to look at	12
and we look at	12
about it this is	12
explain what i mean	12
varying y over the	12
long axis of the	12
the same way the	12
a magical place called	12
the study of how	12
the natural history museum	12
the possibility of a	12
is in some way	12
and then a few	12
can see that these	12
the way it was	12
not in the sense	12
so not only do	12
when we learn that	12
we are interested in	12
so that was a	12
important to recognize that	12
book in the world	12
on their way to	12
the outer surface of	12
how are you doing	12
need to live on	12
and then we need	12
going to get better	12
number needed to treat	12
introduce technology to students	12
come together and create	12
form of life and	12
a different type of	12
for a few seconds	12
that we continue to	12
theres a little bit	12
going to start a	12
he was born in	12
information that was the	12
of our daily lives	12
the other side is	12
if you deal with	12
but theyre not the	12
to go back and	12
was the power of	12
want to put them	12
you can see now	12
job is not to	12
one of the last	12
its not easy but	12
the core of this	12
my first job as	12
that ought to be	12
thing on the left	12
something that would be	12
as well as their	12
go to the disney	12
there are actually two	12
is going to create	12
to keep track of	12
peter jennings announce the	12
a bunch of things	12
his eyes wide open	12
of the world are	12
best place in the	12
smart and fast and	12
in and on us	12
he was trying to	12
i know that this	12
a very real sense	12
mimic some of the	12
right now is to	12
of us to think	12
know what it means	12
is where we are	12
love the idea of	12
because i realized that	12
know so much about	12
air jordan 3 black	12
i think there was	12
pig coughing and sneezing	12
lets look at some	12
iron your cape and	12
it meant to be	12
of the science of	12
us away from the	12
use what i call	12
we have those voices	12
and they were about	12
and your head rotates	12
someone who has a	12
when he was a	12
and they should be	12
matter and dark energy	12
they want to have	12
then we asked them	12
innovative we can be	12
this is our life	12
they remind us that	12
that we can look	12
10 years or so	12
do with the ability	12
and all of you	12
when we go to	12
to apply the force	12
i stutter along the	12
where they come from	12
trained to recognize birds	12
we havent yet gone	12
to the grocery store	12
of a character or	12
be the only one	12
look at the genes	12
type of technology can	12
i thank you and	12
we could talk about	12
a certain point in	12
were never going to	12
a billion and a	12
a place that we	12
and so the first	12
i spell out my	12
i was a bit	12
percent tell the truth	12
and its something we	12
the places that we	12
hard to understand and	12
out how to recycle	12
that i think about	12
the plant and gets	12
dont even know where	12
out that there are	12
the soil doesnt have	12
head of a character	12
this is a device	12
few months ago the	12
and so if you	12
it in their own	12
if it was possible	12
more i thought about	12
so i did the	12
the process of building	12
one of my all	12
how to love each	12
of his arguments with	12
they had a very	12
every corner of this	12
which is not the	12
and i asked her	12
this as a guest	12
the backyard of my	12
you attempt to do	12
is not one big	12
a couple months ago	12
i get to the	12
that 80 percent of	12
the space of words	12
for the benefit of	12
we need it to	12
in the morning i	12
kept us away from	12
would change the way	12
going to focus on	12
false memory that when	12
of who we are	12
like to look at	12
people of muslim heritage	12
was an immense shock	12
and i would read	12
the concept of a	12
movements so as to	12
that the best way	12
each other and the	12
show you how it	12
go back and forth	12
as you well know	12
in the blink of	12
a duty of care	12
the memory of the	12
of the first studies	12
and it will take	12
sounds a lot more	12
the prime minister of	12
to set up a	12
i think were seeing	12
be able to imagine	12
the universe is expanding	12
right brain and the	12
knew you could not	12
to the same place	12
for the foreseeable future	12
many people who have	12
seat at the table	12
think of as a	12
the outsides of these	12
you will notice that	12
he changed his mind	12
you could not fail	12
operating costs are low	12
count on the other	12
of people working on	12
of the time i	12
that make up the	12
millions of people have	12
think so i think	12
in the backyard of	12
to use it to	12
and so one of	12
more than a year	12
and so now we	12
the sound of my	12
a man of my	12
announce the new millennium	12
the right brain and	12
more than a decade	12
in the same year	12
we are doing it	12
four years of age	12
it is possible that	12
some people can hang	12
id like to speak	12
treat other people the	12
on the right hand	12
and we now have	12
and what we think	12
then there are some	12
i wouldnt have been	12
i got involved in	12
a way of being	12
to be talking about	12
idea is you want	12
would we want to	12
ways to think about	12
get some work done	12
not going to run	12
into the middle of	12
that you can download	12
need to consume less	12
minutes and 20 seconds	12
the answer lies in	12
have a friend who	12
that can cause autism	12
synapses in the neural	12
and what theyre doing	12
spent decades trying to	12
buy them for your	12
and thats the result	12
you would like to	12
and i thought i	12
we spent a lot	12
his mind he was	12
it reminds me of	12
a society without fossil	12
and if i wanted	12
can see all the	12
is in fact a	12
less than two percent	12
so this was the	12
you need to live	12
it looks like we	12
were going to save	12
able to account for	12
of the natural world	12
shown over the last	12
my parents and i	12
it makes a difference	12
of that is in	12
all of this work	12
we have the power	12
see the world through	12
and youve got to	12
the details of the	12
a few people who	12
extra sdrs that were	12
go to the right	12
show you one of	12
reached the age of	12
they can grow in	12
i realized i was	12
i noticed that i	12
if you really want	12
youve heard about it	12
and one day i	12
regardless of where they	12
to build another one	12
it spread because we	12
the life out of	12
going to do so	12
to seek asylum in	12
in the eye and	12
have the highest numbers	12
when bees have access	12
that comes to mind	12
to do more leadership	12
we thought this was	12
each one of those	12
what today we would	12
lose a little bit	12
faith in the power	12
out to all the	12
in a time when	12
how we do that	12
i was just like	12
is very important in	12
can learn from them	12
using these types of	12
meet the demands of	12
all kinds of reasons	12
but as much as	12
and have a look	12
and not just the	12
things that we didnt	12
they may not have	12
the spaces between the	12
were interested in the	12
get a sort of	12
if we ever want	12
these songs of freedom	12
and its called the	12
and this would happen	12
very likely to live	12
what they did is	12
in the same direction	12
people in the back	12
we dont actually know	12
the left is the	12
look at the human	12
than the rest of	12
much bigger problem in	12
risk of autism in	12
were going to write	12
to solve all of	12
to create a better	12
and one of his	12
had to be a	12
to do is read	12
twice the size of	12
are going to say	12
and what it is	12
that point in time	12
a little paper you	12
we want to try	12
could look at the	12
all of you know	12
in the room and	12
only time enough to	12
one i want to	12
saw a lot more	12
seeing on the screen	12
i came to the	12
this is like a	12
a new model of	12
i got to work	12
these kinds of things	12
realized that he was	12
is amazing but we	12
to better understand how	12
would have told you	12
it does not work	12
a deep sense of	12
look at the video	12
to bring in the	12
i was kind of	12
that is how we	12
our job is to	12
same size as the	12
i can change the	12
now look at the	12
certain point in time	12
economies in the world	12
of all these things	12
i have been walking	12
allow us to do	12
i invited them to	12
it works is that	12
two particles of light	12
the illusion that were	12
i look through my	12
were listening to a	12
i know that im	12
the united states alone	12
i know this because	12
how innovative we can	12
and its not only	12
of my life i	12
as a necessary act	12
so much of the	12
i had the privilege	12
and thats when the	12
stutter along the way	12
we wanted to be	12
lets get rid of	12
out to be one	12
in our society to	12
we have to keep	12
to understand that the	12
million hives of bees	12
and then theres this	12
now there are thousands	12
want to start by	12
a lot in the	12
talk to people about	12
gamers of foldit solved	12
be captured by the	12
any fossil fuels in	12
and what ive found	12
can hang on to	12
brain in order to	12
and i would ask	12
the length of the	12
three friends and the	12
like all of you	12
than what we have	12
they control the conversation	12
in something called the	12
and then i said	12
head rotates in this	12
the first one that	12
that were printed in	12
a time when the	12
going to go out	12
because it tells us	12
so we had the	12
you can get from	12
she thought i was	12
know that they have	12
children are going to	12
that kept us away	12
gallons per acre per	12
a couple of those	12
is going to allow	12
is that it needs	12
the people that are	12
of bees in the	12
in my previous job	12
do all of these	12
think about they control	12
that are at the	12
gets into the pollen	12
youre struck and your	12
a forest in the	12
you might not have	12
a moral imperative to	12
can create our own	12
it that way we	12
and to what extent	12
that are happening in	12
because its only by	12
but even though the	12
than there are in	12
of the most dangerous	12
your four types of	12
that ive been working	12
so with that in	12
were printed in 2009	12
number two is lying	12
for women in the	12
people to believe that	12
i can make it	12
and how did we	12
how long did it	12
here to show you	12
a very important part	12
and i think a	12
if you looked at	12
50 percent goes in	12
compared to the other	12
think were sort of	12
the new yorker is	12
this is similar to	12
billion tons of co2	11
that i can do	11
did that in the	11
we have as a	11
we didnt get to	11
and look for a	11
i tried to do	11
who care about the	11
of the human condition	11
able to do with	11
people across the world	11
very important that we	11
i was doing my	11
years old at the	11
or in this case	11
of my colleagues had	11
to pick it up	11
have to do this	11
that are essentially the	11
of this part of	11
there were nine of	11
got a bunch of	11
and in an age	11
is another example of	11
go back to my	11
think there was a	11
for a second and	11
have gone through and	11
see where im going	11
never heard of it	11
of what im going	11
of dollars being spent	11
its not a bad	11
to do the job	11
the only place we	11
the point of view	11
to a variety of	11
i knew that the	11
and this leads to	11
you have a problem	11
surface of the planet	11
want to know that	11
and so there was	11
theres no reason for	11
and when we get	11
weve ever seen before	11
and its not the	11
take it to the	11
are now going to	11
difference between success and	11
is a public act	11
to be working with	11
the sight of the	11
thats what ive been	11
to open up to	11
over the space of	11
i think weve all	11
and so i began	11
of the other way	11
a few hundred people	11
a few months after	11
methods in order to	11
have imagined that a	11
one day in the	11
difficult to believe that	11
the entire history of	11
of these people in	11
the idea that all	11
to do is look	11
would be the perfect	11
we want to cure	11
had to be able	11
part of you that	11
we live our lives	11
50 or 100 years	11
few years ago the	11
and this and this	11
he was the first	11
of the genetic information	11
since the year 2000	11
on your way to	11
up to the front	11
over the coming years	11
best in the world	11
them to go back	11
that was created by	11
you know that your	11
can bring the right	11
one of the smartest	11
of time if you	11
of machine learning is	11
interested in doing is	11
give you a couple	11
in this talk that	11
that was a huge	11
the reasons is that	11
that we all agree	11
that this is really	11
on the internet when	11
and the funny thing	11
this was the moment	11
have more and more	11
a pretty good idea	11
my favorite thing to	11
of the dark energy	11
to my left and	11
im sure a lot	11
but this would be	11
and what we are	11
out that there is	11
at the very same	11
i sat down and	11
we cant see it	11
like this one here	11
and theyre more likely	11
but i can make	11
know what to say	11
with all the other	11
is that many of	11
by people who are	11
you can see my	11
it means that you	11
we know were not	11
of you may not	11
during the period of	11
at the head of	11
is because of the	11
the value of a	11
it but i just	11
the news every day	11
solve that problem but	11
make sure that its	11
10 to the 500	11
not the end of	11
the first time and	11
and give them to	11
what were doing here	11
in a decentralized way	11
how long is it	11
lot of time thinking	11
in large parts of	11
come to the conclusion	11
problem that we have	11
think about what it	11
of the light that	11
recently issued a report	11
why dont we start	11
if you give the	11
there may be some	11
tell you the truth	11
average age of an	11
a life well lived	11
might think that this	11
this is the silicon	11
when you write a	11
for good in the	11
and then one day	11
its always been a	11
this is the case	11
and were trying to	11
to meet their climate	11
dark energy or quantum	11
we can all agree	11
were not the only	11
the rise of the	11
so these are all	11
and then they go	11
is that every one	11
that we had a	11
were all in the	11
all the time we	11
if you come back	11
only way we can	11
its part of the	11
to turn on the	11
why i decided to	11
was that there was	11
made them feel like	11
going to be at	11
that tells us that	11
this is that when	11
the top of this	11
half of the world	11
me share with you	11
a whole host of	11
we were a little	11
up to them to	11
this may seem like	11
epic win is an	11
a very simple thing	11
doubt that it is	11
we have a solution	11
so what was the	11
get to know the	11
theres no time for	11
the physics of the	11
do all of the	11
very long time and	11
needle in a haystack	11
people make and how	11
they dont know the	11
that kind of a	11
its not just an	11
a big effect on	11
first of these is	11
as well as an	11
wanted to have a	11
so that all of	11
took me to a	11
and that we have	11
a story to tell	11
and the question i	11
essentially looking at a	11
a place where people	11
going to be different	11
of our own existence	11
to go on the	11
to the notion that	11
going to find the	11
next time you are	11
so i made my	11
to being part of	11
there are only so	11
a ted talk in	11
a sense of where	11
what can we learn	11
aint seen nothing yet	11
me as if i	11
if we continue to	11
and i learned a	11
and he had been	11
that we were doing	11
out of high school	11
do everything we can	11
to do about this	11
and thats where we	11
in and of itself	11
how old do you	11
that it would take	11
thats a real problem	11
a really good idea	11
to get closer to	11
it as sort of	11
you grow up in	11
this is my first	11
are present in the	11
a very young age	11
and i thought it	11
let me share with	11
are trying to solve	11
are only so many	11
wasnt going to be	11
would look like if	11
do with all this	11
this ones for you	11
the eyes of the	11
thats where we are	11
was a way for	11
were going to work	11
you get when you	11
in the company of	11
want you to pay	11
there are plenty of	11
i started to realize	11
to be used in	11
you a video of	11
are more and more	11
sense of where things	11
and they went to	11
our digital lives and	11
i also learned that	11
half billion years ago	11
so i picked up	11
all kinds of people	11
in my research and	11
about what we know	11
ill show you an	11
we want to share	11
think theyre going to	11
made it so that	11
the real world and	11
did all kinds of	11
and in the same	11
want to do and	11
the sum of its	11
and we believe that	11
it was also a	11
when i say that	11
for so long that	11
we can get this	11
there and you can	11
a lot of support	11
want you to feel	11
theres no other way	11
what kind of person	11
me to be a	11
one of the poorest	11
really allowed us to	11
that we knew that	11
alone isnt going to	11
beyond the orbit of	11
to make that choice	11
because our brains have	11
which is a little	11
to ask them to	11
was the first person	11
in ways that are	11
you just a few	11
want to get in	11
ahead of the competition	11
of the world i	11
would be a very	11
we didnt know how	11
just part of the	11
be able to understand	11
but every time i	11
so if you dont	11
of the brain with	11
of course there is	11
has no way of	11
we can all be	11
back in a few	11
the brain so we	11
the issue of the	11
its something that i	11
to wake up and	11
of the universe at	11
done the same thing	11
spend some time with	11
it on the back	11
but i do believe	11
like to ask the	11
win is an outcome	11
about how hard it	11
there should be a	11
you would expect to	11
but its also going	11
where most of the	11
the hole in the	11
when i started working	11
not so long ago	11
and then we started	11
i was living in	11
he went on to	11
we can see with	11
best part of the	11
and if you plot	11
so hard to get	11
so its important that	11
started working on this	11
what about the rest	11
as fast as we	11
a better world than	11
is very likely that	11
just think about that	11
the only place you	11
so if we were	11
think about what they	11
five percent per annum	11
of the young people	11
last year or so	11
thats the first time	11
why does it matter	11
you still have to	11
first thing we did	11
build a better world	11
when they want to	11
and this is quite	11
most people think about	11
can imagine that if	11
just a few minutes	11
is so good for	11
the panama papers that	11
and theyve got a	11
one of the issues	11
we had to make	11
are dying in war	11
world we need to	11
at least once a	11
and not just for	11
think all of you	11
an email from a	11
as the president of	11
to flow across the	11
had a little bit	11
try to tackle the	11
and thats going to	11
we can get to	11
so wouldnt it be	11
when i wake up	11
then we wouldnt have	11
the safest way to	11
compared to what were	11
dollars being spent on	11
of the built environment	11
are where we are	11
to make up the	11
feel that we have	11
i have a new	11
but apart from that	11
that they needed to	11
it dawned on me	11
have to listen to	11
it makes me wonder	11
and it made it	11
tell me that i	11
but in other cases	11
machines are going to	11
what it is to	11
we have not done	11
that all over the	11
whats interesting about this	11
but i just want	11
suggest to you that	11
this comes from the	11
what happens with the	11
but i dont really	11
all sorts of ways	11
that gives you an	11
we did it in	11
and here you can	11
we are one of	11
to move forward and	11
friends and family and	11
i have been thinking	11
the time i got	11
they did it was	11
where i live in	11
the problem of how	11
now theres a lot	11
able to create a	11
theyre not allowed to	11
how we feel and	11
upper part of the	11
but the more i	11
then you can take	11
we will see in	11
do this all the	11
the first world war	11
of the world today	11
shoulder to shoulder with	11
try to make a	11
is to bring these	11
and if i was	11
close to the sun	11
got in touch with	11
he is going to	11
can do it again	11
thing that ive learned	11
reducing the amount of	11
and then we look	11
the problem with that	11
been flipped on its	11
i was fascinated by	11
this for a minute	11
at the forefront of	11
ill show you a	11
world to see how	11
we have to own	11
i happen to know	11
i first went to	11
men and women were	11
ability to learn and	11
we can get the	11
because they have better	11
were going to change	11
that was a pretty	11
i was doing was	11
smart and funny and	11
of what we know	11
lets call it the	11
but when we look	11
to find out the	11
i do not have	11
you put it in	11
we should be thinking	11
could be used to	11
was born in a	11
didnt know any better	11
just give you one	11
in the first three	11
not just for the	11
into one of the	11
were going to win	11
in the bottom of	11
to take control of	11
he was one of	11
little bit like this	11
to come back in	11
of people are very	11
of my talk is	11
much do you think	11
to ask for help	11
and then im going	11
many of you probably	11
and i actually think	11
did you do with	11
they have to go	11
do more with less	11
a long way off	11
all the time what	11
i do with this	11
as we move forward	11
keep an eye on	11
do a pretty good	11
least once a week	11
very nature of the	11
the inside of the	11
you next is a	11
of it its not	11
and it is important	11
i have an app	11
rest of the time	11
we have to solve	11
we are where we	11
a few examples of	11
and in the lower	11
so we asked ourselves	11
were looking for another	11
to really explore the	11
very first time that	11
back at the first	11
i dont have all	11
members of his family	11
to get you to	11
i am the first	11
are tens of thousands	11
and its giving us	11
to understand that there	11
that if we can	11
is the era of	11
theres all sorts of	11
are going to make	11
to do the things	11
introduce you to the	11
sort of thing that	11
to go out to	11
had nothing to fear	11
role to play in	11
the director of the	11
times more likely to	11
here in the middle	11
the 19th century that	11
reason is that we	11
maybe in the future	11
we realized that we	11
when i look back	11
the exact spot where	11
it turns out we	11
take a moment and	11
what it does is	11
you have all of	11
if we were able	11
down at the bottom	11
huge amount of data	11
the men in the	11
all the way out	11
in the middle ages	11
you think you see	11
the world will be	11
not to harm them	11
of things that can	11
that is that the	11
of the political spectrum	11
from social media data	11
that we can tell	11
in the process and	11
to see how it	11
by the age of	11
lets go ahead and	11
it is a world	11
when you wake up	11
is only going to	11
have been with us	11
tell you about what	11
while at the same	11
it turns out were	11
there are two things	11
of one of my	11
being part of the	11
you have ever been	11
want to improve our	11
balls in the air	11
may actually be a	11
to think of as	11
doing this all the	11
now the idea of	11
its my job to	11
the worst thing thats	11
cities around the world	11
they didnt know what	11
to grow into the	11
they come from a	11
gives you an idea	11
the first time they	11
in the new world	11
cannot tell you the	11
we can bring the	11
around the world its	11
wouldnt have been able	11
from one generation to	11
i hope you will	11
to a few friends	11
spend more time with	11
this is where my	11
85 percent of all	11
get in a car	11
whats great about this	11
reminds me of the	11
large parts of the	11
together and decided to	11
and a lot more	11
that it might be	11
but we have an	11
in the same sentence	11
and if youre lucky	11
the gravitational pull of	11
on a date with	11
being part of a	11
and if youre trying	11
have to pay for	11
this idea of what	11
and they do it	11
to talk to each	11
the news of the	11
shown in red and	11
were trying to figure	11
here you see the	11
its quite the opposite	11
and the way to	11
the human brain is	11
its going to end	11
that we as a	11
how well you work	11
do it and we	11
to join us in	11
couple of hours later	11
i took a job	11
to all sorts of	11
the objects that have	11
i would much rather	11
blown away by the	11
man and a woman	11
all of the data	11
did is we took	11
four hours a day	11
when i was born	11
all the different possible	11
thinking that we can	11
the other problem was	11
the world it was	11
dont even need to	11
of that i was	11
not quite sure why	11
but we can look	11
a long list of	11
what happens to those	11
in one of his	11
going to be going	11
would not be able	11
entering a new era	11
new york times and	11
of carbon dioxide in	11
at a lot of	11
when i came to	11
dont really want to	11
were in danger of	11
is a huge challenge	11
speed of light and	11
i want to convey	11
found is that the	11
and that allows us	11
for the next two	11
when we have to	11
we would have a	11
larger than the width	11
provides us with a	11
have a number of	11
the difference between an	11
only way you can	11
and answer the question	11
i was when i	11
they sense their neighbors	11
it this is an	11
look at a couple	11
more than that if	11
but in many ways	11
and i opened up	11
or maybe its the	11
look like if it	11
look at it as	11
on her back and	11
look at their brains	11
and the main thing	11
the middle of my	11
is why we have	11
are essentially the same	11
on the way up	11
since the beginning of	11
and what i learned	11
to tell the stories	11
and i think were	11
so many of these	11
we see is that	11
reason is that in	11
about 10 years old	11
weve just looked at	11
but when i read	11
what they are doing	11
do is to take	11
and go to the	11
one has ever seen	11
beginning of this talk	11
can actually see the	11
all of the species	11
and i felt this	11
have to live with	11
trying to do with	11
that we wish we	11
we have the will	11
very hard to get	11
are at the top	11
and i just thought	11
of the world from	11
what happens when a	11
we find ways to	11
the magnetic field of	11
up a whole bunch	11
so that in the	11
we know that it	11
we know that if	11
lot of questions about	11
but now we have	11
evidence to the contrary	11
not only do they	11
to ensure that the	11
about a decade ago	11
been part of the	11
felt this sense of	11
woke up in the	11
i was very young	11
that i dont know	11
having this kind of	11
she was the kind	11
need to know this	11
before you know it	11
more than a thousand	11
think that they are	11
have to do the	11
and once we see	11
come from the ocean	11
you see that in	11
the art of living	11
of it as sort	11
that we still have	11
so one day i	11
can learn how to	11
bottom of the plane	11
you ever made a	11
thing that struck me	11
that blew my mind	11
is kind of the	11
when i was six	11
the way we build	11
be able to measure	11
they are part of	11
a team of researchers	11
this is how he	11
go back to our	11
and thats where the	11
wanted to know if	11
going to be talking	11
and so it was	11
aspect of our daily	11
of the things im	11
to look inside the	11
that if you were	11
more powerful than the	11
think about this in	11
in the place of	11
its not just me	11
to me that this	11
but a few years	11
to say is that	11
us one of the	11
think we can be	11
you can also look	11
the control of the	11
were doing is making	11
precisely because it is	11
we thought that the	11
we put into the	11
see in the red	11
we can try to	11
first job as a	11
the sense that they	11
was a pretty big	11
had gotten out of	11
you for listening to	11
sense of fairness and	11
and when it comes	11
for the existence of	11
and if it is	11
but what if you	11
an image of the	11
in positions of power	11
things you have to	11
you have a big	11
because i was one	11
with a couple of	11
is a much more	11
will not be the	11
you can go back	11
i dont remember anything	11
is that the only	11
its not worrying about	11
not just for small	11
i did i went	11
up to you to	11
i know there are	11
and there are people	11
when i was five	11
from the shores of	11
la la la la	11
a different point of	11
the evolution of the	11
and its about time	11
is it was a	11
the wrong side of	11
on millions of problem	11
that will fundamentally change	11
every once in a	11
and be willing to	11
could come up with	11
in the private sector	11
to the world around	11
and to the right	11
the more they can	11
to the streets and	11
but how does it	11
and i like to	11
on the planet in	11
on the bottom and	11
we do not want	11
of the relationship between	11
so help me out	11
of how we see	11
why would you do	11
be able to continue	11
to enable us to	11
to seriously consider a	11
you can buy off	11
in the wrong direction	11
the age of 12	11
every time one of	11
we cant afford to	11
looking at other peoples	11
at that moment that	11
any one of your	11
there are several ways	11
that when people have	11
and for a long	11
people that we are	11
is that its really	11
i just couldnt believe	11
we can understand that	11
theyre going to die	11
of thinking that we	11
went back to work	11
you dont know where	11
say nothing of the	11
a long time in	11
need to learn how	11
that was when i	11
more than 100 years	11
for those who dont	11
it means that the	11
i had no interest	11
watts of power and	11
you how it works	11
you might even think	11
things that weve been	11
things that can be	11
from side to side	11
and this is only	11
to keep us safe	11
the human body is	11
when we go out	11
would like you to	11
by the same token	11
the next few minutes	11
the presence of a	11
young men and women	11
and at the very	11
to see on millions	11
and so forth so	11
this is different than	11
that you can have	11
that is the way	11
robots are going to	11
the strength of the	11
like to have a	11
so we are just	11
and a few other	11
for all of these	11
back and think about	11
may not know this	11
to make sure you	11
how about this one	11
its about time we	11
not going to show	11
by telling you a	11
see in the world	11
so its not a	11
have to sort of	11
which is not that	11
on here is that	11
the upper part of	11
they need to take	11
was at a time	11
lot of you might	11
and he has a	11
we have a long	11
and then finally we	11
is happening in the	11
to me and i	11
where you can actually	11
to be this way	11
a system that we	11
i gave a talk	11
look at the statistics	11
were able to use	11
they might be able	11
how did you get	11
in our understanding of	11
love is not the	11
and no matter what	11
on earth you can	11
was going on and	11
to know more about	11
to be saying that	11
societies around the world	11
be viewed as a	11
and we will have	11
have to do better	11
that was pretty much	11
the effects of the	11
that will allow you	11
that can do any	11
what he meant by	11
ask you a question	11
came to this country	11
i didnt know how	11
a country that has	11
even if you think	11
because you have a	11
was based on the	11
to be back in	11
why would you ever	11
i can use this	11
what you might see	11
half of the 20th	11
and we get our	11
life that i had	11
brings us back to	11
they were asking for	11
why would you want	11
and these were the	11
dont think about it	11
that i would never	11
so we need a	11
and lots and lots	11
that for the whole	11
to do any of	11
of a life well	11
been pushed out of	11
no matter how hard	11
just happens to be	11
the world if you	11
thats not what im	11
and i am the	11
real world to the	11
person in the world	11
it depends on how	11
want you to see	11
in the newspaper the	11
to build it in	11
i am trying to	11
but youve got to	11
its a very good	11
feel that we are	11
to do this with	11
thats an important thing	11
in our own minds	11
to make a small	11
i opened my eyes	11
they may have a	11
so it would be	11
an ability to think	11
a science of consciousness	11
surface of mars and	11
to find a cure	11
came up with was	11
why does this happen	11
but if we want	11
is that humans are	11
this this is how	11
it stands to reason	11
i am talking about	11
and this tells us	11
to you i have	11
the ig nobel prize	11
a little bit but	11
wars in iraq and	11
took to the streets	11
of whats happening in	11
an example of that	11
this was a very	11
that they have the	11
ive been talking for	11
you have a baby	11
the first of its	11
i have nothing to	11
so what did they	11
think that it is	11
it was sort of	11
my research has shown	11
in a few minutes	11
change we know that	11
top of everything else	11
we get to a	11
a couple of reasons	11
this happen in the	11
sum of its parts	11
just want to be	11
this is because they	11
thing that comes to	11
the line in the	11
be good or bad	11
top of the world	11
be the source of	11
of the reasons that	11
to say the least	11
youre just going to	11
in the shoes of	11
years from now so	11
who they are in	11
told me that when	11
look at the moon	11
in charge of the	11
from my point of	11
is to make a	11
further and further apart	11
we see the same	11
and i can look	11
think the most important	11
need to do the	11
tell us about that	11
world in which the	11
and most of these	11
was developed by a	11
what i told you	11
end with a quote	11
theres a number of	11
also need to be	11
this is not enough	11
everything in the world	11
i look at my	11
able to get a	11
but of course the	11
that we can work	11
and it was my	11
they all have a	11
3 oclock in the	11
for each and every	11
may be hard to	11
for us it was	11
we are very interested	11
that was the start	11
surface of the sun	11
is it that i	11
a way that no	11
my grandfather was a	11
to basically make a	11
good in the world	11
not an easy task	11
the source of all	11
so i hope to	11
what was happening to	11
the right to be	11
percent of them were	11
years ago with the	11
so we went back	11
there to make sure	11
and the basic idea	11
the same thing about	11
to hold on to	11
when you hear about	11
are getting better at	11
years ago at the	11
while the rest of	11
we know and what	11
dont even know which	11
in the scientific community	11
had no interest in	11
buy off the shelf	11
heart of the matter	11
what is the use	11
whats happening on the	11
theyre much more likely	11
many different ways that	11
that you cant do	11
we can have the	11
take the words and	11
think there are several	11
want to stay in	11
and that is because	11
this was not something	11
what happens to me	11
the world and when	11
to your brain and	11
the responsibility of the	11
for the last 20	11
more than three times	11
close and personal with	11
this is an incredible	11
out of the station	11
how did you do	11
we started to see	11
learned so much from	11
how to make that	11
and the last thing	11
maybe you get a	11
and i decided that	11
most of what we	11
the products that we	11
is true of the	11
i was at the	11
of those people are	11
in the global south	11
and they take a	11
it a few times	11
but you also share	11
the life of all	11
of you who arent	11
to do everything we	11
to learn from the	11
an image like this	11
but we also know	11
and make all of	11
the point here is	11
by a guy named	11
if we do it	11
face of someone who	11
more than a few	11
as well there are	11
willing to engage in	11
and in this way	11
come to us through	11
adapt to climate change	11
of the second world	11
and probably the most	11
of a new era	11
on the surface and	11
found myself in a	11
what happened with the	11
and so what im	11
a lot of difference	11
that does not mean	11
are looking at the	11
you will be able	11
almost think of it	11
you can almost think	11
only thing i could	11
what we are working	11
it turns out he	11
means we can do	11
a pool of water	11
turn up the heat	11
it has the power	11
does this tell us	11
we will have to	11
thats just the start	11
the way that weve	11
reminds us that we	11
and after a couple	11
the choices that we	11
show you a video	11
where you have a	11
first of its kind	11
to get into a	11
the same question as	11
with a set of	11
plant and this is	11
it it was a	11
get away from the	11
a problem in the	11
of how this works	11
i was about 10	11
talk about a failure	11
when people think of	11
idea of the multiverse	11
a lion or a	11
the usage of the	11
and take a look	11
all that we had	11
can compare this to	11
that you think that	11
and at that time	11
for one another its	11
it was hard to	11
can be reduced to	11
to make this second	11
so much bigger than	11
like you see here	11
is helping us to	11
what are you reading	11
i found was that	11
use it in the	11
a mystery in the	11
much more powerful than	11
and when it does	11
not to have to	11
in the deep sea	11
new york city in	11
solve some of the	11
it is for the	11
the european union is	11
nice thing about this	11
whether we like it	11
less than five percent	11
the world where there	11
will never be able	11
this happens to be	11
data im going to	11
the middle of something	11
sure a lot of	11
us we are not	11
are so many things	11
it has to stand	11
so after a few	11
and so here i	11
the money that they	11
in a few months	11
its actually happening all	11
you look at our	11
and just like we	11
most of you will	11
and i went through	11
you would have thought	11
to leave the country	11
and before you know	11
do with my life	11
in all of us	11
that at some point	11
that weve been able	11
generation to the next	11
is not that much	11
want to end with	11
i might as well	11
in the formation of	11
that was the moment	11
back to the nest	11
problem is that we	11
but there is another	11
like we do with	11
that its impossible to	11
so they can be	11
i really like this	11
if youre interested in	11
time in my entire	11
fact that she was	11
technology comes to us	11
the second is the	11
we have a choice	11
i could not go	11
the face of someone	11
out in the street	11
the past and the	11
of the next century	11
can talk to me	11
i think we know	11
im asking you to	11
piece of paper and	11
im so proud of	11
even be able to	11
take control of the	11
is a completely different	11
of mine who had	11
is by looking at	11
we were there with	11
is the most recent	11
and i can start	11
the 20th century that	11
each other and to	11
im going to illustrate	11
we have to give	11
little bit about that	11
that we can only	11
little bit of it	11
if you happen to	11
in front of my	11
see on millions of	11
what it looked like	11
way that we think	11
so now im going	11
and each one of	11
hundred years from now	11
in that kind of	11
for all time to	11
a community like this	11
you ever wondered what	11
solar system was formed	11
the truth and to	11
that we have an	11
that you could have	11
be able to study	11
of them was a	11
not going to take	11
each others faces and	11
with a system that	11
and i moved to	11
im doing now is	11
pretty good idea of	11
three or four years	11
of an animal that	11
teach our kids how	11
a place where we	11
and translate them into	11
i thought it would	11
at me as if	11
one of the robots	11
i live in new	11
and not in the	11
and i didnt want	11
here so we need	11
of these things that	11
id like to give	11
of the project is	11
way the world is	11
if you take that	11
need more than just	11
with a story about	11
to need a lot	11
to use it in	11
thought at the time	11
to run for president	11
get all of the	11
have a conversation about	11
so today i want	11
we have an example	11
we were told to	11
who are like us	11
from the 21st century	11
you might think about	11
this is not what	11
making a lot of	11
and i know you	11
they can have a	11
reality is that we	11
it can also help	11
so i think you	11
from just a few	11
around the world today	11
over 50 million years	11
lets look at one	11
they tell us that	11
watching one of my	11
but thats not really	11
its not something that	11
caught up in the	11
that was one of	11
but then i started	11
was funded by the	11
but all of this	11
we talk about it	11
the developing world and	11
think about how you	11
and its time for	11
tended to focus on	11
is going to determine	11
next time you see	11
to have a choice	11
to be doing and	11
but this is only	11
wanted to go and	11
in a village with	11
is telling us that	11
everything we can to	11
is that it comes	11
voice in my head	11
the library of congress	11
the importance of our	11
this map of the	11
and i could see	11
who i am and	11
you dont see it	11
i was born with	11
are people in the	11
going to learn that	11
a world that we	11
the way that this	11
has been going on	11
the same as a	11
have different parts of	11
as long as the	11
the political and economic	11
and when i started	11
i would look at	11
percent of people in	11
my favorite part of	11
if you dont use	11
can connect with each	11
was asked this question	11
as you go down	11
in my life i	11
was 18 years old	11
to try to answer	11
to give up the	11
one generation to the	11
i tell them i	11
so many different ways	11
end of this talk	11
a society in which	11
we are all connected	11
we have never seen	11
afford to do it	11
the right distance from	11
far from the sun	11
there was always a	11
its not really a	11
be about giving people	11
been going on for	11
and i really wanted	11
you know this is	11
throughout all of this	11
just give you a	11
was a bit of	11
more likely to bring	11
can be used in	11
thought it was the	11
this can be done	11
its up to them	11
this is whats happening	11
to learn to do	11
we have to know	11
but the truth was	11
about as much as	11
going to help the	11
is more or less	11
i had to have	11
can you do with	11
you didnt even have	11
is a word that	11
that there are certain	11
going to sit on	11
so i looked at	11
and for that reason	11
never going to happen	11
do that with the	11
and it wasnt until	11
a big problem for	11
tell the story about	11
and you can imagine	11
new kinds of thinking	11
heres the best part	11
we use a lot	11
it feels like were	11
that i believe is	11
know where you are	11
is that we need	11
you know what youre	11
happened to be in	11
thats what i thought	11
ever since i was	11
we can take this	11
does not have to	11
i was a girl	11
on the day that	11
not just scientists and	11
because thats what we	11
and i was having	11
of people and i	11
out of the window	11
was the first of	11
can almost think of	11
you see with the	11
that there could be	11
of dollars a year	11
a very important but	11
was one of my	11
me start with the	11
with a network of	11
to 40 percent of	11
youd have to figure	11
fall in love but	11
the companies that are	11
something that isnt just	11
very first year of	11
that we think of	11
which is that theres	11
were just going to	11
and then if you	11
what a lot of	11
they are not alone	11
as the story is	11
beginning of this year	11
run the risk of	11
it for the first	11
we go through this	11
not what im saying	11
from the bottom up	11
and to do so	11
well this is a	11
thing you can see	11
now we want to	11
to do to get	11
is going to help	11
and put them together	11
into the center of	11
we dont even notice	11
our goal was to	11
taking care of the	11
when people have a	11
we see that theres	11
have to try and	11
bit of a problem	11
to win this race	11
the key to the	11
we can build a	11
think we all have	11
all of you here	11
have access to this	11
at the time was	11
why i believe that	11
another thing that i	11
an example of the	11
back to what i	11
is why we are	11
had a lot to	11
least in the united	11
the last several years	11
on most of our	11
the members of the	11
so its very easy	11
change the course of	11
it in the first	11
very different from what	11
the economic and political	11
this is the era	11
to us in life	11
now we need to	11
here is to be	11
left side of his	11
to get it right	11
to be just as	11
more than a hundred	11
the war in syria	11
our attention to the	11
doing it in the	11
brain compared to a	11
to know where to	11
that we do in	11
and if there was	11
the people around you	11
you dont think of	11
any one of us	11
trying to change the	11
starts at a very	11
because i dont have	11
look at the history	11
to fix the problem	11
where does it come	11
branch of artificial intelligence	11
player in the world	11
is the technology thats	11
the thing that struck	11
is what the us	11
i was on an	11
do this in a	11
food and drug administration	11
you choose not to	11
it isnt just a	11
id like to say	11
to know a lot	11
where it is and	11
the whole global economy	11
and to this day	11
getting out of a	11
the development of these	11
im really excited about	11
tell you how to	11
to fight climate change	11
an idea that we	11
they dont know that	11
to the moon and	11
its what we do	11
the same that we	11
that i would have	11
does a plant need	11
to go to college	11
to get through the	11
to own up to	11
that this is actually	11
it wasnt until the	11
that i was asked	11
think about them and	11
out for one another	11
he said that he	11
i dont know whats	11
something like this this	11
i believe that if	11
they live in a	11
what we have in	11
basic idea is that	11
find out whats going	11
youre really going to	11
a scanning electron microscope	11
changes over time so	11
have been talking about	11
is to take a	11
map of the united	11
have to take the	11
and privacy is the	11
more or less the	11
so lets go back	11
way of doing that	11
between success and failure	11
need to see on	11
to the south pole	11
just one of those	11
for the last time	11
just the right distance	11
and it was designed	11
have a solution to	11
in the united nations	11
meters above sea level	11
and at the age	11
and we need it	11
had to find a	11
its also involved in	11
up all over the	11
and there are three	11
a hundred years from	11
going to work on	11
why dont we have	11
find out that the	11
we did not have	11
what it can do	11
so what is this	11
exactly the same as	11
reason is that when	11
and they didnt want	11
dont have to get	11
years ago in the	11
want to address the	11
some of us have	11
thought about it for	11
what youre about to	11
our hearts and our	11
began to see that	11
i had my own	11
to recognize that we	11
a high school student	11
its important to realize	11
dont know if i	11
need to sit down	11
interesting is that the	11
youre looking at here	11
the legs of the	11
noticed that a lot	11
we are not a	11
did they have to	11
i was going through	11
a bunch of sensors	11
goods and services to	11
you give them the	11
talk to me about	11
dust from the sahara	11
above the surface of	11
there will always be	11
its hard to see	11
that we have come	11
now and in the	11
it gives us a	11
about this idea of	11
with the same kind	11
now if you look	11
this is another example	11
a lot of disgust	11
about two or three	11
for boys and girls	11
the same way we	11
so we went out	11
it so that the	11
we can turn off	11
and i told her	11
did a survey of	11
sitting next to you	11
hard for me to	11
do some of the	11
a better way to	11
the tone of the	11
that are involved in	11
the first time now	11
going to create some	11
cannot tell you how	11
do it on a	11
going to be okay	11
want to come back	11
you want to work	11
to a depth of	11
into the job market	11
ive got to say	11
in my lab we	11
in terms of economic	11
at the bottom is	11
issued a report on	11
felt that i had	11
is that they have	11
are a kind of	11
but it has to	11
and i do think	11
to do it on	11
not going to really	11
front of the tank	11
i started to investigate	11
in response to that	11
and the bottom line	11
can be sure of	11
have to make it	11
times stronger than the	11
you dont know it	11
of its kind in	11
that we were women	11
the light from the	11
get in touch with	11
i was on my	11
a new class of	11
like this you can	11
is to understand the	11
it allowed us to	11
mean for the future	11
to survive and i	11
this is important stuff	11
way of doing this	11
those who have no	11
where we really have	11
to help us make	11
i got back to	11
i would be a	11
i was obsessed with	11
us the ability to	11
living in a community	11
for life on mars	11
a man and a	11
to do in my	11
in terms of both	11
but its also the	11
we still have to	11
and thats the sort	11
you can imagine how	11
what its going to	11
asked me to play	11
theres a reason why	11
there are all these	11
that we can find	11
to hear about the	11
from the center of	11
from the earth and	11
was talking to the	11
there was all this	11
share with you this	11
one in a thousand	11
example of how we	11
what youre saying is	11
thinking that it was	11
know how to deal	11
couple of examples of	11
when you go on	11
hear a lot of	11
doing many of the	11
this was the very	11
and it grows and	11
all kinds of stuff	11
go to the hospital	11
that we work with	11
were doing is taking	11
possible until you achieved	11
on a lot of	11
the interests of the	11
we all have an	11
a unique opportunity to	11
i know this sounds	11
where you have to	11
was coming out of	11
out of three people	11
at the peak of	11
what it really is	11
take care of our	11
an understanding of the	11
now we can see	11
you cant even see	11
do a lot more	11
look at something like	11
climate change we know	11
and probably a lot	11
look at this picture	11
i wasnt doing anything	11
i had to see	11
lot of time to	11
i have to get	11
is home to the	11
to go on to	11
is to find the	11
can detect tumors in	11
go back in time	11
its true that i	11
how do we solve	11
a really hard time	11
i can make a	11
one is going to	11
but even more important	11
this is our problem	11
know what it was	11
happening in the world	11
terms of the science	11
trying to find new	11
on the coast of	11
how many people have	11
in the solomon islands	11
need to get a	11
that sounds like a	11
if you havent been	11
been able to find	11
and across the world	11
just so happens that	11
that we have been	11
and they dont have	11
there had to be	11
then the computer can	11
same time that we	11
so thats the third	11
when were in a	11
until you achieved it	11
for the world to	11
piece of bad news	11
of the stuff that	11
the oceans of the	11
it is a little	11
and i say to	11
i go on television	11
the effects of a	11
know and what we	11
time to go into	11
can be defined in	11
to stay connected to	11
that there was not	11
in a position where	11
in the world would	11
got all the answers	11
we do about it	11
and you ask yourself	11
its our responsibility to	11
that allowed me to	11
next couple of years	11
because if you have	11
just going to give	11
and thats that the	11
important part of the	11
with this is that	11
ought to be able	11
all i want to	11
for me to even	11
which one of the	11
to convince you of	11
come up with these	11
were going to raise	11
is that i know	11
how theyre going to	11
at the world through	11
i can do is	11
see the big picture	11
and you feed it	11
that leads to a	11
that happens to us	11
caught up in a	11
make sure that our	11
the subject of a	11
it belongs to the	11
thats going to make	11
want to give a	11
have the capability to	11
is im going to	11
that they could make	11
and we can watch	11
billions of dollars being	11
of the human experience	11
youre talking about a	11
we hear a lot	11
this sounds like the	11
but its a very	11
it doesnt matter what	11
you may think that	11
we like it or	11
that leads to the	11
quality of life and	11
is an issue that	11
for them to die	11
physical world and the	11
they used to do	11
is that in order	11
and thousands of people	11
the brain of an	11
i felt this sense	11
to show you this	11
do in order to	11
the places where the	11
to look forward to	11
would have us believe	11
and if you could	11
to fly the plane	11
time and time again	11
because were going to	11
you buy a car	11
more like this in	11
look at the sky	11
96 percent of the	11
because it could mean	11
of you as a	11
we can make this	11
of them are very	11
things like this happen	11
it would be the	11
but if youre a	11
to be a woman	11
one of the simplest	11
used to have a	11
do you see that	11
the future and so	11
is less than half	11
i was doing the	11
of people on the	11
was about a year	11
just a tiny bit	11
like to say that	11
a bad place to	11
of what is possible	11
and i worked on	11
in a moment of	11
like some sort of	11
and i needed to	11
and they asked them	11
i love you more	11
is different this is	11
of a mountain and	11
take them out of	11
is actually the first	11
just because of the	11
at the new york	11
we see the world	11
and it was all	11
in the war on	11
i wont go into	11
what do we know	11
i had to find	11
each other and with	11
so we can use	11
have that kind of	11
only thing that we	11
energy from the sun	11
is a terrible thing	11
in your own backyard	11
thats not the only	11
people in order to	11
be determined by the	11
and i was able	11
kinds of things to	11
to get a handle	11
and as i say	11
different kinds of things	11
were going to know	11
love you more than	11
that they were more	11
so if we wanted	11
and i started thinking	11
is going to try	11
into the world of	11
look out for one	11
people like you and	11
were going to end	11
and by the end	11
another point of view	11
i just had to	11
dont worry about it	11
for the past seven	11
give you some examples	11
lets see what happens	11
the united states are	11
us to make a	11
learn how to read	11
you to remember that	11
is the same one	11
theres a few things	11
and i went there	11
and im not a	11
youre saying is that	11
us in ways that	11
remember what it was	11
power can also be	11
from the point of	11
anyone in the world	11
i were in the	11
kinds of people who	11
because i have to	11
it was really a	11
weve got to take	11
is to think of	11
because youre going to	11
kinds of things were	11
for each of the	11
you to go to	11
billion dollars worth of	11
one to the other	11
the first one i	11
and we see it	11
some of the rules	11
many of you use	11
climate change and we	11
to figure that out	11
so i turned to	11
is sort of the	11
recent study from the	11
but they dont solve	11
because for the first	11
of where things are	11
and the first one	11
lot of time and	11
a sense of being	11
that was the question	11
little bit about why	11
your way out of	11
do we make this	11
that were working on	11
not to get a	11
everywhere in the world	11
i had become a	11
thanks for your email	11
and that if we	11
we are a small	11
people and of course	11
now how do we	11
if you just look	11
can buy off the	11
there are those of	11
i do know is	11
cars on the road	11
and i couldnt find	11
but i just wanted	11
the volume of the	11
i got all the	11
they going to be	11
one thing you can	11
it difficult to believe	11
to be better than	11
been lucky enough to	11
and for all of	11
im not really sure	11
theres just a lot	11
been known for a	11
to have to decide	11
few years from now	11
to do the work	11
if you move the	11
like all of us	11
but they were told	11
you go out and	11
them at all times	11
were trying to save	11
on the backs of	11
