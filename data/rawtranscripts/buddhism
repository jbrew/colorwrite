As a conceptual artist,
I'm constantly looking for creative ways
to spark challenging conversations.
I do this though painting, sculpture,
video and performance.
But regardless of the format,
two of my favorite materials
are history and dialogue.
 
In 2007, I created "Lotus,"
a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,
600-pound glass depiction
of a lotus blossom.
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol
for transcendence
and for purity of mind and spirit.
But a closer look at this lotus
reveals each petal
to be the cross-section of a slave ship.
This iconic diagram was taken
from a British slaving manual
and later used by abolitionists to show
the atrocities of slavery.
In America, we don't like
to talk about slavery,
nor do we look at it as a global industry.
But by using this Buddhist symbol,
I hope to universalize and transcend
the history and trauma of black America
and encourage discussions
about our shared past.
 
To create "Lotus,"
we carved over 6,000 figures.
And this later led to a commission
by the City of New York
to create a 28-foot version in steel
as a permanent installation
at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,
a school for black and latino students,
the two groups most affected
by this history.
The same two groups are very affected
by a more recent phenomenon,
but let me digress.
 
I've been collecting
wooden African figures
from tourist shops and flea markets
around the world.
The authenticity and origin
of them is completely debatable,
but people believe these
to be imbued with power,
or even magic.
Only recently have I figured out
how to use this in my own work.
 
(Gun shots)
 
Since 2012, the world has witnessed
the killings of Trayvon Martin,
Michael Brown, Eric Garner,
Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice
and literally countless other
unarmed black citizens
at the hands of the police,
who frequently walk away
with no punishment at all.
In consideration of these victims
and the several times that even I,
a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,
have been targeted and harassed
at gunpoint by the police.
I created this body of work
simply entitled "BAM."
 
It was important to erase
the identity of each of these figures,
to make them all look the same
and easier to disregard.
To do this, I dip them in a thick,
brown wax
before taking them to a shooting range
where I re-sculpted them using bullets.
And it was fun,
playing with big guns and
high-speed video cameras.
But my reverence for these figures
kept me from actually pulling the trigger,
somehow feeling as if I would
be shooting myself.
Finally, my cameraman, Raul,
fired the shots.
I then took the fragments of these
and created molds,
and cast them first in wax,
and finally in bronze
like the image you see here,
which bears the marks
of its violent creation
like battle wounds or scars.
 
When I showed this work recently in Miami,
a woman told me she felt
every gun shot to her soul.
But she also felt that these artworks
memorialized the victims of these killings
as well as other victims of
racial violence throughout US history.
 
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger
than just US history.
While showing in Berlin last year,
a philosophy student asked me
what prompted these recent killings.
I showed him a photo
of a lynching postcard
from the early 1900s
and reminded him that these killings
have been going on for over 500 years.
But it's only through questions like his
and more thoughtful dialogue
about history and race
can we evolve as individuals and society.
 
I hope my artwork creates a safe space
for this type of honest exchange
and an opportunity for people
to engage one another
in real and necessary conversation.
 
Thank you.

In case you are wondering,
no, I'm not wearing a dress,
and no, I'm not saying
what I'm wearing underneath.
 
()
 
This is a gho.
This is my national dress.
This is how all men dress in Bhutan.
That is how our women dress.
Like our women,
we men get to wear pretty bright colors,
but unlike our women,
we get to show off our legs.
 
()
 
Our national dress is unique,
but this is not the only thing
that's unique about my country.
Our promise to remain
carbon neutral is also unique,
and this is what I'd like
to speak about today,
our promise to remain carbon neutral.
 
But before I proceed,
I should set you the context.
I should tell you our story.
 
Bhutan is a small country
in the Himalayas.
We've been called Shangri-La,
even the last Shangri-La.
But let me tell you right off the bat,
we are not Shangri-La.
My country is not one big monastery
populated with happy monks.
 
()
 
The reality is that
there are barely 700,000 of us
sandwiched between two
of the most populated countries on earth,
China and India.
The reality is that we are a small,
underdeveloped country
doing our best to survive.
But we are doing OK. We are surviving.
In fact, we are thriving,
and the reason we are thriving
is because we've been blessed
with extraordinary kings.
Our enlightened monarchs
have worked tirelessly
to develop our country,
balancing economic growth carefully
with social development,
environmental sustainability
and cultural preservation,
all within the framework
of good governance.
We call this holistic approach
to development
"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.
Back in the 1970s,
our fourth king famously
pronounced that for Bhutan,
Gross National Happiness is more important
than Gross National Product.
 
()
 
Ever since,
all development in Bhutan
is driven by GNH,
a pioneering vision
that aims to improve the happiness
and well-being of our people.
 
But that's easier said than done,
especially when you are one
of the smallest economies in the world.
Our entire GDP is less
than two billion dollars.
I know that some of you here
are worth more --
 
()
 
individually
than the entire economy of my country.
 
So our economy is small,
but here is where it gets interesting.
Education is completely free.
All citizens are guaranteed
free school education,
and those that work hard
are given free college education.
Healthcare is also completely free.
Medical consultation,
medical treatment, medicines:
they are all provided by the state.
We manage this
because we use our limited
resources very carefully,
and because we stay faithful
to the core mission of GNH,
which is development with values.
Our economy is small,
and we must strengthen it.
Economic growth is important,
but that economic growth must not come
from undermining our unique culture
or our pristine environment.
 
Today, our culture is flourishing.
We continue to celebrate
our art and architecture,
food and festivals,
monks and monasteries.
And yes, we celebrate
our national dress, too.
This is why I can wear my gho with pride.
Here's a fun fact:
you're looking
at the world's biggest pocket.
 
()
 
It starts here,
goes around the back,
and comes out from inside here.
In this pocket
we store all manner of personal goods
from phones and wallets
to iPads, office files and books.
 
()
 
()
 
But sometimes --
sometimes even precious cargo.
 
So our culture is flourishing,
but so is our environment.
72 percent of my country
is under forest cover.
Our constitution demands
that a minimum of 60 percent
of Bhutan's total land
shall remain under forest cover
for all time.
 
()
 
Our constitution,
this constitution,
imposes forest cover on us.
Incidentally, our king
used this constitution
to impose democracy on us.
You see, we the people
didn't want democracy.
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,
and we certainly didn't fight for it.
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us
by insisting that he include it
in the constitution.
But he went further.
He included provisions in the constitution
that empower the people
to impeach their kings,
and included provisions in here
that require all our kings to retire
at the age of 65.
 
()
 
Fact is, we already have
a king in retirement:
our previous king, the Great Fourth,
retired 10 years ago
at the peak of his popularity.
He was all of 51 years at that time.
 
So as I was saying,
72 percent of our country
is under forest cover,
and all that forest is pristine.
That's why we are one of the few remaining
global biodiversity hotspots in the world,
and that's why we are
a carbon neutral country.
In a world that is threatened
with climate change,
we are a carbon neutral country.
 
Turns out, it's a big deal.
Of the 200-odd countries
in the world today,
it looks like we are the only one
that's carbon neutral.
Actually, that's not quite accurate.
Bhutan is not carbon neutral.
Bhutan is carbon negative.
Our entire country generates
2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,
but our forests, they sequester
more than three times that amount,
so we are a net carbon sink
for more than four million tons
of carbon dioxide each year.
But that's not all.
 
()
 
We export most
of the renewable electricity
we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.
So today, the clean energy that we export
offsets about six million tons
of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.
By 2020, we'll be exporting
enough electricity
to offset 17 million tons
of carbon dioxide.
And if we were to harness
even half our hydropower potential,
and that's exactly what we are working at,
the clean, green energy that we export
would offset something like
50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.
That is more CO2 than what the entire city
of New York generates in one year.
 
So inside our country,
we are a net carbon sink.
Outside, we are offsetting carbon.
And this is important stuff.
You see, the world is getting warmer,
and climate change is a reality.
Climate change is affecting my country.
Our glaciers are melting,
causing flash floods and landslides,
which in turn are causing disaster
and widespread destruction in our country.
I was at that lake recently.
It's stunning.
That's how it looked 10 years ago,
and that's how it looked 20 years ago.
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.
It was a solid glacier.
A few years ago, a similar lake
breached its dams
and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.
That destruction
was caused by one glacier lake.
We have 2,700 of them to contend with.
The point is this:
my country and my people have done nothing
to contribute to global warming,
but we are already bearing the brunt
of its consequences.
And for a small, poor country,
one that is landlocked and mountainous,
it is very difficult.
But we are not going to sit
on our hands doing nothing.
We will fight climate change.
That's why we have promised
to remain carbon neutral.
 
We first made this promise in 2009
during COP 15 in Copenhagen,
but nobody noticed.
Governments were so busy
arguing with one another
and blaming each other
for causing climate change,
that when a small country
raised our hands and announced,
"We promise to remain
carbon neutral for all time,"
nobody heard us.
Nobody cared.
 
Last December in Paris,
at COP 21, we reiterated our promise
to remain carbon neutral
for all time to come.
This time, we were heard.
We were noticed, and everybody cared.
What was different in Paris
was that governments came round together
to accept the realities of climate change,
and were willing to come together
and act together and work together.
All countries, from the very small
to the very large,
committed to reduce
the greenhouse gas emissions.
The UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change
says that if these so-called
intended commitments are kept,
we'd be closer
to containing global warming
by two degrees Celsius.
 
By the way,
I've requested the TED organizers here
to turn up the heat in here
by two degrees,
so if some of you
are feeling warmer than usual,
you know who to blame.
 
It's crucial that all of us
keep our commitments.
As far as Bhutan is concerned,
we will keep our promise
to remain carbon neutral.
Here are some of the ways we are doing it.
We are providing free electricity
to our rural farmers.
The idea is that, with free electricity,
they will no longer have to use firewood
to cook their food.
We are investing in sustainable transport
and subsidizing the purchase
of electric vehicles.
Similarly, we are subsidizing
the cost of LED lights,
and our entire government
is trying to go paperless.
We are cleaning up our entire country
through Clean Bhutan, a national program,
and we are planting trees
throughout our country
through Green Bhutan,
another national program.
 
But it is our protected areas
that are at the core
of our carbon neutral strategy.
Our protected areas are our carbon sink.
They are our lungs.
Today, more than half
our country is protected,
as national parks, nature reserves
and wildlife sanctuaries.
But the beauty is that we've connected
them all with one another
through a network of biological corridors.
Now, what this means
is that our animals are free
to roam throughout our country.
Take this tiger, for example.
It was spotted
at 250 meters above sea level
in the hot, subtropical jungles.
Two years later, that same tiger
was spotted near 4,000 meters
in our cold alpine mountains.
Isn't that awesome?
 
()
 
We must keep it that way.
We must keep our parks awesome.
So every year, we set aside resources
to prevent poaching, hunting,
mining and pollution in our parks,
and resources to help communities
who live in those parks
manage their forests,
adapt to climate change,
and lead better lives while continuing
to live in harmony with Mother Nature.
 
But that is expensive.
Over the next few years,
our small economy won't have the resources
to cover all the costs that are required
to protect our environment.
In fact, when we run the numbers,
it looks like it'll take us
at least 15 years
before we can fully finance
all our conservation efforts.
But neither Bhutan,
nor the world
can afford to spend 15 years
going backwards.
 
This is why His Majesty the King
started Bhutan For Life.
Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.
It gives us breathing room.
It is essentially a funding mechanism
to look after our parks,
to protect our parks,
until our government
can take over on our own fully.
The idea is to raise a transition fund
from individual donors,
corporations and institutions,
but the deal is closed only
after predetermined conditions are met
and all funds committed.
So multiparty, single closing:
an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.
This means that individual donors
can commit without having to worry
that they'll be left
supporting an underfunded plan.
It's something like a Kickstarter project,
only with a 15-year time horizon
and millions of tons
of carbon dioxide at stake.
Once the deal is closed,
we use the transition fund
to protect our parks,
giving our government time
to increase our own funding gradually
until the end of the 15-year period.
After that, our government
guarantees full funding forever.
 
We are almost there.
We expect to close later this year.
Naturally, I'm pretty excited.
 
()
 
The World Wildlife Fund
is our principle partner in this journey,
and I want to give them a big shoutout
for the excellent work
they are doing in Bhutan
and across the world.
 
()
 
Whew, it is getting warm in here.
 
I thank you for listening to our story,
a story of how we are keeping
our promise to remain carbon neutral,
a story of how we are keeping
our country pristine,
for ourselves, our children,
for your children and for the world.
But we are not here
to tell stories, are we?
We are here to dream together.
So in closing, I'd like to share
one more dream that I have.
What if we could mobilize
our leadership and our resources,
our influence and our passion,
to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea
to other countries
so that they too
can conserve their
protected areas for all time.
After all, there are many other countries
who face the same issues that we face.
They too have natural resources
that can help win the world's fight
for sustainability,
only they may not have the ability
to invest in them now.
So what if we set up Earth For Life,
a global fund, to kickstart
the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?
I invite you to help me,
to carry this dream beyond our borders
to all those who care
about our planet's future.
After all, we're here to dream together,
to work together,
to fight climate change together,
to protect our planet together.
Because the reality is
we are in it together.
Some of us might dress differently,
but we are in it together.
 
Thank you very much,
and kadrin chhe la. Thank you.
 
()
 
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 
We live in an incredibly busy world.
The pace of life is often frantic,
our minds are always busy,
and we're always doing something.
 
So with that in mind,
I'd like you just to take a moment
to think, when did you last take
any time to do nothing?
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?
And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.
So that's no emailing,
texting, no Internet,
no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.
Not even sitting there
reminiscing about the past
or planning for the future.
Simply doing nothing.
I see a lot of very blank faces.
 
()
 
You probably have to go a long way back.
 
And this is an extraordinary thing, right?
We're talking about our mind.
The mind, our most valuable
and precious resource,
through which we experience
every single moment of our life.
The mind that we rely upon
to be happy, content,
emotionally stable as individuals,
and at the same time,
to be kind and thoughtful
and considerate
in our relationships with others.
This is the same mind that we depend upon
to be focused, creative, spontaneous,
and to perform at our very best
in everything that we do.
And yet, we don't take
any time out to look after it.
In fact, we spend more time
looking after our cars,
our clothes and our hair than we --
okay, maybe not our hair,
 
()
 
but you see where I'm going.
 
The result, of course,
is that we get stressed.
You know, the mind whizzes away
like a washing machine
going round and round,
lots of difficult, confusing emotions,
and we don't really know
how to deal with that.
And the sad fact
is that we are so distracted
that we're no longer present
in the world in which we live.
We miss out on the things
that are most important to us,
and the crazy thing
is that everybody just assumes,
that's the way life is, so we've just
kind of got to get on with it.
That's really not how it has to be.
 
So I was about 11 when I went along
to my first meditation class.
And trust me, it had all the stereotypes
that you can imagine,
the sitting cross-legged on the floor,
the incense, the herbal tea,
the vegetarians, the whole deal,
but my mom was going and I was intrigued,
so I went along with her.
I'd also seen a few kung fu movies,
and secretly I kind of thought
I might be able to learn how to fly,
but I was very young at the time.
Now as I was there, I guess,
like a lot of people,
I assumed that it was just
an aspirin for the mind.
You get stressed, you do some meditation.
I hadn't really thought that it could be
sort of preventative in nature,
until I was about 20, when a number
of things happened in my life
in quite quick succession,
really serious things
which just flipped my life upside down
and all of a sudden
I was inundated with thoughts,
inundated with difficult emotions
that I didn't know how to cope with.
Every time I sort of pushed one down,
another one would pop back up again.
It was a really very stressful time.
 
I guess we all deal with stress
in different ways.
Some people will bury themselves in work,
grateful for the distraction.
Others will turn to their friends,
their family, looking for support.
Some people hit the bottle,
start taking medication.
My own way of dealing with it
was to become a monk.
So I quit my degree,
I headed off to the Himalayas,
I became a monk, and I started
studying meditation.
 
People often ask me
what I learned from that time.
Well, obviously it changed things.
Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk
is going to change a number of things.
But it was more than that.
It taught me -- it gave me
a greater appreciation,
an understanding for the present moment.
By that I mean not being lost in thought,
not being distracted,
not being overwhelmed
by difficult emotions,
but instead learning how to be
in the here and now,
how to be mindful, how to be present.
 
I think the present moment
is so underrated.
It sounds so ordinary,
and yet we spend so little time
in the present moment
that it's anything but ordinary.
There was a research paper that came
out of Harvard, just recently,
that said on average, our minds
are lost in thought
almost 47 percent of the time.
47 percent.
At the same time, this sort
of constant mind-wandering
is also a direct cause of unhappiness.
Now we're not here for that long anyway,
but to spend almost half
of our life lost in thought
and potentially quite unhappy,
I don't know, it just kind
of seems tragic, actually,
especially when there's something
we can do about it,
when there's a positive,
practical, achievable,
scientifically proven technique
which allows our mind to be more healthy,
to be more mindful and less distracted.
 
And the beauty of it is that even though
it need only take about 10 minutes a day,
it impacts our entire life.
But we need to know how to do it.
We need an exercise.
We need a framework
to learn how to be more mindful.
That's essentially what meditation is.
It's familiarizing ourselves
with the present moment.
But we also need to know
how to approach it in the right way
to get the best from it.
And that's what these are for,
in case you've been wondering,
because most people assume
that meditation
is all about stopping thoughts,
getting rid of emotions,
somehow controlling the mind,
but actually it's quite
different from that.
It's more about stepping back,
sort of seeing the thought clearly,
witnessing it coming and going,
emotions coming and going
without judgment,
but with a relaxed, focused mind.
 
So for example, right now,
if I focus too much on the balls,
then there's no way I can relax
and talk to you at the same time.
Equally, if I relax too much
talking to you,
there's no way I can focus on the balls.
I'm going to drop them.
Now in life, and in meditation,
there'll be times when the focus
becomes a little bit too intense,
and life starts to feel a bit like this.
It's a very uncomfortable
way to live life,
when you get this tight and stressed.
At other times, we might take our foot off
the gas a little bit too much,
and things just become a sort
of little bit like this.
Of course in meditation --
 
(Snores)
 
we're going to end up falling asleep.
So we're looking for a balance,
a focused relaxation
where we can allow thoughts to come and go
without all the usual involvement.
 
Now, what usually happens
when we're learning to be mindful
is that we get distracted by a thought.
Let's say this is an anxious thought.
Everything's going fine,
and we see the anxious thought.
"Oh, I didn't realize
I was worried about that."
You go back to it, repeat it.
"Oh, I am worried.
I really am worried.
Wow, there's so much anxiety."
And before we know it, right,
we're anxious about feeling anxious.
 
()
 
You know, this is crazy.
We do this all the time,
even on an everyday level.
If you think about the last time
you had a wobbly tooth.
You know it's wobbly,
and you know that it hurts.
But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?
 
(Mumbling)
 
It does hurt.
And we reinforce the storyline, right?
And we just keep telling ourselves,
and we do it all the time.
And it's only in learning
to watch the mind in this way
that we can start to let go
of those storylines and patterns of mind.
But when you sit down
and you watch the mind in this way,
you might see many different patterns.
You might find a mind
that's really restless and --
the whole time.
Don't be surprised if you feel
a bit agitated in your body
when you sit down to do nothing
and your mind feels like that.
You might find a mind that's very dull
and boring, and it's just,
almost mechanical,
it just seems it's as if you're
getting up, going to work,
eat, sleep, get up, work.
Or it might just be
that one little nagging thought
that just goes round and round your mind.
 
Well, whatever it is,
meditation offers the opportunity,
the potential to step back
and to get a different perspective,
to see that things aren't always
as they appear.
We can't change every little thing
that happens to us in life,
but we can change
the way that we experience it.
That's the potential
of meditation, of mindfulness.
You don't have to burn any incense,
and you definitely don't have
to sit on the floor.
All you need to do
is to take 10 minutes out a day
to step back, to familiarize yourself
with the present moment
so that you get to experience
a greater sense
of focus, calm and clarity in your life.
 
Thank you very much.

I want to address the issue of compassion.
Compassion has many faces.
Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;
some of them are tender; some of them are wise.
A line that the Dalai Lama once said,
he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.
They are not luxuries.
Without them,
humanity cannot survive."
And I would suggest,
it is not only humanity that won't survive,
but it is all species on the planet,
as we've heard today.
It is the big cats,
and it's the plankton.
 
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.
I was so privileged
to be able to teach in a hospice
on the outskirts of Bangalore.
And early in the morning,
I went into the ward.
In that hospice,
there were 31 men and women
who were actively dying.
And I walked up to the bedside
of an old woman
who was breathing very rapidly, fragile,
obviously in the latter phase
of active dying.
I looked into her face.
I looked into the face
of her son sitting next to her,
and his face was just riven
with grief and confusion.
 
And I remembered
a line from the Mahabharata,
the great Indian epic:
"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"
And Yudhisthira replied,
"The most wondrous thing in the world
is that all around us
people can be dying
and we don't realize
it can happen to us."
I looked up.
Tending those 31 dying people
were young women
from villages around Bangalore.
I looked into the face of one of these women,
and I saw in her face
the strength that arises
when natural compassion is really present.
I watched her hands
as she bathed an old man.
 
My gaze went to another young woman
as she wiped the face
of another dying person.
And it reminded me
of something that I had just been present for.
Every year or so,
I have the privilege of taking clinicians
into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
And we run clinics
in these very remote regions
where there's no medical care whatsoever.
 
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla,
far west of Nepal,
the most impoverished region of Nepal,
an old man came in
clutching a bundle of rags.
And he walked in, and somebody said something to him,
we realized he was deaf,
and we looked into the rags,
and there was this pair of eyes.
The rags were unwrapped
from a little girl
whose body was massively burned.
Again,
the eyes and hands
of Avalokiteshvara.
It was the young women, the health aids,
who cleaned the wounds of this baby
and dressed the wounds.
 
I know those hands and eyes;
they touched me as well.
They touched me at that time.
They have touched me throughout my 68 years.
They touched me when I was four
and I lost my eyesight
and was partially paralyzed.
And my family brought in
a woman whose mother had been a slave
to take care of me.
And that woman
did not have sentimental compassion.
She had phenomenal strength.
And it was really her strength, I believe,
that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur
that has been a guiding light in my life.
 
So we can ask:
What is compassion comprised of?
And there are various facets.
And there's referential and non-referential compassion.
But first, compassion is comprised
of that capacity
to see clearly
into the nature of suffering.
It is that ability
to really stand strong
and to recognize also
that I'm not separate from this suffering.
But that is not enough,
because compassion,
which activates the motor cortex,
means that we aspire,
we actually aspire to transform suffering.
And if we're so blessed,
we engage in activities
that transform suffering.
But compassion has another component,
and that component is really essential.
That component
is that we cannot be attached to outcome.
 
Now I worked with dying people
for over 40 years.
I had the privilege of working on death row
in a maximum security [prison] for six years.
And I realized so clearly
in bringing my own life experience,
from working with dying people
and training caregivers,
that any attachment to outcome
would distort deeply
my own capacity to be fully present
to the whole catastrophe.
 
And when I worked in the prison system,
it was so clear to me, this:
that many of us
in this room,
and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,
the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.
That compassion is actually
an inherent human quality.
It is there within every human being.
But the conditions
for compassion to be activated,
to be aroused,
are particular conditions.
I had that condition, to a certain extent,
from my own childhood illness.
Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,
has had that condition activated
amazingly in her
through the various waters of suffering
that she has been through.
 
And what is fascinating
is that compassion has enemies,
and those enemies are things like pity,
moral outrage,
fear.
And you know, we have a society, a world,
that is paralyzed by fear.
And in that paralysis, of course,
our capacity for compassion
is also paralyzed.
The very word terror
is global.
The very feeling of terror is global.
So our work, in a certain way,
is to address this imago,
this kind of archetype
that has pervaded the psyche
of our entire globe.
 
Now we know from neuroscience
that compassion has
some very extraordinary qualities.
For example:
A person who is cultivating compassion,
when they are in the presence of suffering,
they feel that suffering a lot more
than many other people do.
However,
they return to baseline a lot sooner.
This is called resilience.
Many of us think that compassion drains us,
but I promise you
it is something that truly enlivens us.
 
Another thing about compassion
is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
It hooks up all parts of the brain.
Another, which has been discovered
by various researchers
at Emory and at Davis and so on,
is that compassion enhances our immune system.
Hey,
we live in a very noxious world.
()
Most of us are shrinking
in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,
of the toxins of our world.
But compassion, the generation of compassion,
actually mobilizes
our immunity.
 
You know, if compassion is so good for us,
I have a question.
Why don't we train our children
in compassion?
()
If compassion is so good for us,
why don't we train our health care providers in compassion
so that they can do what they're supposed to do,
which is to really transform suffering?
And if compassion is so good for us,
why don't we vote on compassion?
Why don't we vote for people in our government
based on compassion,
so that we can have
a more caring world?
In Buddhism,
we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."
It takes tremendous strength of the back
to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.
 
But it also takes a soft front --
the capacity to really be open to the world as it is,
to have an undefended heart.
And the archetype of this in Buddhism
is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.
It's a female archetype:
she who perceives
the cries of suffering in the world.
She stands with 10,000 arms,
and in every hand,
there is an instrument of liberation,
and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,
and these are the eyes of wisdom.
I say that, for thousands of years,
women have lived,
exemplified, met in intimacy,
the archetype of Avalokitesvara,
of Kuan-Yin,
she who perceives
the cries of suffering in the world.
 
Women have manifested for thousands of years
the strength arising from compassion
in an unfiltered, unmediated way
in perceiving suffering
as it is.
They have infused societies with kindness,
and we have really felt that
as woman after woman
has stood on this stage
in the past day and a half.
And they have actualized compassion
through direct action.
Jody Williams called it:
It's good to meditate.
I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.
Step back, give your mother a break, okay.
 
()
 
But the other side of the equation
is you've got to come out of your cave.
You have to come into the world
like Asanga did,
who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha
after 12 years sitting in the cave.
He said, "I'm out of here."
He's going down the path.
He sees something in the path.
He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.
The wound is just filled with maggots.
He puts out his tongue
in order to remove the maggots,
so as not to harm them.
And at that moment,
the dog transformed
into the Buddha of love and kindness.
 
I believe
that women and girls today
have to partner in a powerful way with men --
with their fathers,
with their sons, with their brothers,
with the plumbers, the road builders,
the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,
with our president,
and with all beings.
The women in this room
are lotuses in a sea of fire.
May we actualize that capacity
for women everywhere.
 
Thank you.

I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership
in the 21st century.
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --
is to go back to our school days
when we learned how to count.
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.
Because what we actually count
truly counts.
 
Let me start by telling you a little story.
This is Van Quach.
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
She changed her name to Vivian
because she wanted to fit in here in America.
Her first job was at an inner-city motel
in San Francisco as a maid.
I happened to buy that motel
about three months after Vivian started working there.
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
 
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,
in 1987,
I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,
a very impractical name,
because I actually was looking to create joy of life.
And this first hotel that I bought, motel,
was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel
in the inner-city of San Francisco.
As I spent time with Vivian,
I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre
in how she did her work.
It made me question and curious:
How could someone actually find joy
in cleaning toilets for a living?
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that
she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
Her job, her goal and her calling
was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection
she created with her fellow employees and our guests.
And what gave her inspiration and meaning
was the fact that she was taking care of people
who were far away from home.
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.
 
That very human lesson,
more than 20 years ago,
served me well during the last
economic downturn we had.
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,
San Francisco Bay Area hotels
went through the largest percentage revenue drop
in the history of American hotels.
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,
so we were particularly vulnerable.
But also back then,
remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
Well, not exactly, of course not.
We started eating "freedom fries,"
and we started boycotting anything that was French.
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --
so I started getting these letters
from places like Alabama and Orange County
saying to me that they were going to boycott my company
because they thought we were a French company.
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."
 
()
 
So one particular day
when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,
I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore
looking for a business solution.
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up
in the self-help section very quickly.
That's where I got reacquainted with
Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."
I took one psychology class in college,
and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,
as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
But as I sat there for four hours,
the full afternoon, reading Maslow,
I recognized something
that is true of most leaders.
One of the simplest facts in business
is something that we often neglect,
and that is that we're all human.
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,
has some hierarchy of needs
in the workplace.
 
So as I started reading more Maslow,
what I started to realize is that
Maslow, later in his life,
wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual
and apply it to the collective,
to organizations and specifically to business.
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,
and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.
So I realized in that dotcom crash
that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
And that's what I did a few years ago
when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid
and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,
which is survival, success and transformation.
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
And we started asking ourselves the questions
about how we were actually addressing
the higher needs, these transformational needs
for our key employees in the company.
These three levels of the hierarchy needs
relate to the five levels
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
 
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing
the higher needs of our employees and our customers,
I realized we had no metrics.
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
So we started asking ourselves:
What kind of less obvious metrics
could we use to actually evaluate
our employees' sense of meaning,
or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?
For example, we actually started asking our employees,
do they understand the mission of our company,
and do they feel like they believe in it,
can they actually influence it,
and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?
We started asking our customers,
did they feel an emotional connection with us,
in one of seven different kinds of ways.
Miraculously, as we asked these questions
and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,
what we found is we created more loyalty.
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
Our employee turnover dropped
to one-third of the industry average,
and during that five year dotcom bust,
we tripled in size.
 
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there
and asking them how they were getting through that time,
what they told me over and over again
was that they just manage what they can measure.
What we can measure is that tangible stuff
at the bottom of the pyramid.
They didn't even see the intangible stuff
higher up the pyramid.
So I started asking myself the question:
How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,
and all we can measure is the tangible in life,
we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.
 
So I went out and studied a bunch of things,
and I found a survey that showed
that 94 percent
of business leaders worldwide
believe that the intangibles are important in their business,
things like intellectual property,
their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,
and yet, only five percent of those same leaders
actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
So as leaders, we understand
that intangibles are important,
but we don't have a clue how to measure them.
So here's another Einstein quote:
"Not everything that can be counted counts,
and not everything that counts can be counted."
I hate to argue with Einstein,
but if that which is most valuable
in our life and our business
actually can't be counted or valued,
aren't we going to spend our lives
just mired in measuring the mundane?
 
It was that sort of heady question about what counts
that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week
and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,
a place some folks call Shangri-La.
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid
to becoming a transformational
role model for the world.
I went to Bhutan.
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,
but this was back in 1972,
when he ascended to the throne
two days after his father passed away.
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions
that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.
 
On a trip through India,
early in his reign as king,
he was asked by an Indian journalist
about the Bhutanese GDP,
the size of the Bhutanese GDP.
The king responded in a fashion
that actually has transformed us four decades later.
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed
and focused with gross domestic product?
Why don't we care more about
gross national happiness?"
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider
an alternative definition of success,
what has come to be known as
GNH, or gross national happiness.
Most world leaders didn't take notice,
and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."
But the king was serious.
This was a notable moment,
because this was the first time a world leader
in almost 200 years
had suggested
that intangible of happiness --
that leader 200 years ago,
Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --
200 years later,
this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness
is something that we should measure,
and it's something we should actually value
as government officials.
 
For the next three dozen years as king,
this king actually started measuring
and managing around happiness in Bhutan --
including, just recently, taking his country
from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy
with no bloodshed, no coup.
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,
is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.
 
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,
I got to really understand what they're doing.
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
I asked him,
"How can you create and measure
something which evaporates --
in other words, happiness?"
And he's a very wise man, and he said,
"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."
Wow, that's interesting.
He said that they have a science behind that art,
and they've actually created four essential pillars,
nine key indicators
and 72 different metrics
that help them to measure their GNH.
One of those key indicators is:
How do the Bhutanese feel about
how they spend their time each day?
It's a good question. How do you feel about
how you spend your time each day?
Time is one of the scarcest resources
in the modern world.
And yet, of course,
that little intangible piece of data
doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.
 
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,
I started to imagine
what I call an emotional equation.
And it focuses on something I read long ago
from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
How many know him? Anybody?
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"
and he suggested that happiness
is not about having what you want;
instead, it's about wanting what you have.
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe
happiness equals wanting what you have --
imagine gratitude --
divided by having what you want --
gratification.
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,
constantly focused on what they don't have.
Their religion, their isolation,
their deep respect for their culture
and now the principles of their GNH movement
all have fostered a sense of gratitude
about what they do have.
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,
spend more of our time
in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?
We are a bottom-heavy culture
in more ways than one.
 
()
 
The reality is, in Western countries,
quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness
as if happiness is something that we have to go out --
an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.
Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,
many dictionaries define pursuit
as to "chase with hostility."
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?
Good question. But back to Bhutan.
 
Bhutan's bordered on its north and south
by 38 percent of the world's population.
Could this little country,
like a startup in a mature industry,
be the spark plug that influences
a 21st century
of middle-class in China and India?
Bhutan's created the ultimate export,
a new global currency of well-being,
and there are 40 countries around the world today
that are studying their own GNH.
You may have heard, this last fall
Nicolas Sarkozy in France
announcing the results of an 18-month study
by two Nobel economists,
focusing on happiness and wellness in France.
Sarkozy suggested that
world leaders should stop
myopically focusing on GDP
and consider a new index,
what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."
I like it.
Co-branding opportunities.
 
Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,
we had a simulcast of David Cameron,
potentially the next prime minister of the UK,
quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,
Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968
when he suggested that we're
myopically focused on the wrong thing
and that GDP is a misplaced metric.
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
 
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,
and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
This is a collection of things
that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
GDP counts everything from air pollution
to the destruction of our redwoods.
But it doesn't count the health of our children
or the integrity of our public officials.
As you look at these two columns here,
doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us
to start figuring out a new way to count,
a new way to imagine
what's important to us in life?
 
()
 
Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.
He said GDP "measures everything in short,
except that which makes life worthwhile."
Wow.
So how do we do that?
Let me say one thing we can just start doing
ten years from now, at least in this country.
Why in the heck in America
are we doing a census in 2010?
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.
But all of those questions are tangible.
They're about demographics.
They're about where you live, how many people you live with,
and whether you own your home or not.
That's about it.
We're not asking meaningful metrics.
We're not asking important questions.
We're not asking anything that's intangible.
 
Abe Maslow said long ago
something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,
everything starts to look like a nail."
We've been fooled by our tool.
Excuse that expression.
()
We've been fooled by our tool.
GDP has been our hammer.
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century
industrial-era model of success.
And yet, 64 percent
of the world's GDP today
is in that intangible industry we call service,
the service industry, the industry I'm in.
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries
of manufacturing and agriculture.
So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that
doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,
but actually counts what we most value,
the things that are intangible.
 
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.
I learned that economists measure everything
in tangible units of production and consumption
as if each of those tangible units
is exactly the same.
They aren't the same.
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn
is that we can influence
the quality of that unit of production
by creating the conditions
for our employees to live their calling.
In Vivian's case,
her unit of production
isn't the tangible hours she works,
it's the intangible difference she makes
during that one hour of work.
 
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually
been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.
He stayed there a hundred times
in the last 20 years,
and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship
that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
He tells me that he can always count
on Vivian and the staff there
to make him feel at home.
Why is it that
business leaders and investors
quite often don't see the connection
between creating the intangible
of employee happiness
with creating the tangible
of financial profits in their business?
We don't have to choose between
inspired employees and sizable profits,
we can have both.
In fact, inspired employees quite often
help make sizable profits, right?
 
So what the world needs now,
in my opinion,
is business leaders and political leaders
who know what to count.
We count numbers.
We count on people.
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers
to truly take into account our people.
I learned that from a maid in a motel
and a king of a country.
What can you
start counting today?
What one thing can you start counting today
that actually would be meaningful in your life,
whether it's your work life or your business life?
 
Thank you very much.

Probably a lot of you know
the story of the two salesmen
who went down to Africa in the 1900s.
They were sent down to find
if there was any opportunity
for selling shoes,
and they wrote telegrams
back to Manchester.
And one of them wrote,
"Situation hopeless. Stop.
They don't wear shoes."
And the other one wrote,
"Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet."

Now, there's a similar situation
in the classical music world,
because there are some people who think
that classical music is dying.
And there are some of us
who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
And rather than go
into statistics and trends,
and tell you about all the orchestras
that are closing,
and the record companies that are folding,
I thought we should do
an experiment tonight.
Actually, it's not really an experiment,
because I know the outcome.
 
()
 
But it's like an experiment.
Now, before we start --
 
()
 
Before we start, I need to do two things.
One is I want to remind you
of what a seven-year-old child
sounds like when he plays the piano.
Maybe you have this child at home.
He sounds something like this.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
I see some of you recognize this child.
Now, if he practices for a year
and takes lessons, he's now eight
and he sounds like this.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
He practices for another year
and takes lessons -- he's nine.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
Then he practices for another year
and takes lessons -- now he's 10.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
At that point, they usually give up.
 
()
 
()
 
Now, if you'd waited for one more year,
you would have heard this.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
Now, what happened was not
maybe what you thought,
which is, he suddenly
became passionate, engaged,
involved, got a new teacher,
he hit puberty, or whatever it is.
What actually happened
was the impulses were reduced.
You see, the first time, he was playing
with an impulse on every note.
 
(Music)
 
And the second,
with an impulse every other note.
 
(Music)
 
You can see it by looking at my head.
 
()
 
The nine-year-old put
an impulse on every four notes.
 
(Music)
 
The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
 
(Music)
 
And the 11-year-old,
one impulse on the whole phrase.
 
(Music)
 
I don't know how
we got into this position.
 
()
 
I didn't say, "I'm going to move
my shoulder over, move my body."
No, the music pushed me over,
which is why I call it
one-buttock playing.
 
(Music)
 
It can be the other buttock.
 
(Music)
 
You know, a gentleman was once
watching a presentation I was doing,
when I was working with a young pianist.
He was the president
of a corporation in Ohio.
I was working with
this young pianist, and said,
"The trouble with you
is you're a two-buttock player.
You should be a one-buttock player."
I moved his body while he was playing.
And suddenly, the music took off.
It took flight.
The audience gasped
when they heard the difference.
Then I got a letter from this gentleman.
He said, "I was so moved.
I went back and I transformed
my entire company
into a one-buttock company."
 
()
 
Now, the other thing I wanted
to do is to tell you about you.
There are 1,600 people, I believe.
My estimation is that probably 45 of you
are absolutely passionate
about classical music.
You adore classical music.
Your FM is always on that classical dial.
You have CDs in your car,
and you go to the symphony,
your children are playing instruments.
You can't imagine your life
without classical music.
That's the first group, quite small.
Then there's another bigger group.
The people who don't mind classical music.
 
()
 
You know, you've come home
from a long day,
and you take a glass of wine,
and you put your feet up.
A little Vivaldi in the background
doesn't do any harm.
That's the second group.
Now comes the third group:
people who never listen
to classical music.
It's just simply not part of your life.
You might hear it like second-hand
smoke at the airport ...
 
()
 
-- and maybe a little bit
of a march from "Aida"
when you come into the hall.
But otherwise, you never hear it.
That's probably the largest group.
 
And then there's a very small group.
These are the people
who think they're tone-deaf.
Amazing number of people think
they're tone-deaf.
Actually, I hear a lot,
"My husband is tone-deaf."
 
()
 
Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.
Nobody is tone-deaf.
If you were tone-deaf,
you couldn't change the gears
on your car, in a stick shift car.
You couldn't tell the difference between
somebody from Texas
and somebody from Rome.
And the telephone. The telephone.
If your mother calls
on the miserable telephone,
she calls and says, "Hello,"
you not only know who it is,
you know what mood she's in.
You have a fantastic ear.
Everybody has a fantastic ear.
So nobody is tone-deaf.
 
But I tell you what.
It doesn't work for me
to go on with this thing,
with such a wide gulf
between those who understand,
love and are passionate
about classical music,
and those who have
no relationship to it at all.
The tone-deaf people,
they're no longer here.
But even between those three categories,
it's too wide a gulf.
So I'm not going to go on
until every single person in this room,
downstairs and in Aspen,
and everybody else looking,
will come to love
and understand classical music.
So that's what we're going to do.
 
Now, you notice that there is not
the slightest doubt in my mind
that this is going to work,
if you look at my face, right?
It's one of the characteristics
of a leader that he not doubt
for one moment the capacity
of the people he's leading
to realize whatever he's dreaming.
Imagine if Martin Luther King
had said, "I have a dream.
Of course, I'm not sure
they'll be up to it."

All right. So I'm going
to take a piece of Chopin.
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.
Some of you will know it.
 
(Music)
 
Do you know what I think
probably happened here?
When I started, you thought,
"How beautiful that sounds."
 
(Music)
 
"I don't think we should
go to the same place
for our summer holidays next year."
 
()
 
It's funny, isn't it?
It's funny how those thoughts
kind of waft into your head.
And of course --
 
()
 
Of course, if the piece is long
and you've had a long day,
you might actually drift off.
Then your companion
will dig you in the ribs
and say, "Wake up! It's culture!"
And then you feel even worse.
 
()
 
But has it ever occurred to you
that the reason you feel sleepy
in classical music is not
because of you, but because of us?
Did anybody think while I was playing,
"Why is he using so many impulses?"
If I'd done this with my head you
certainly would have thought it.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
And for the rest of your life,
every time you hear classical music,
you'll always be able to know
if you hear those impulses.
 
So let's see what's really going on here.
We have a B. This is a B.
The next note is a C.
And the job of the C is to make the B sad.
And it does, doesn't it?
 
()
 
Composers know that.
If they want sad music,
they just play those two notes.
 
(Music)
 
But basically, it's just a B,
with four sads.
 
()
 
Now, it goes down to A.
Now to G.
And then to F.
So we have B, A, G, F.
And if we have B, A, G, F,
what do we expect next?
 
(Music)
 
That might have been a fluke.
Let's try it again.
 
(Music)
 
Oh, the TED choir.
 
()
 
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
Nobody is.
You know, every village in Bangladesh
and every hamlet in China
-- everybody knows:
da, da, da, da -- da.
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
 
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,
because what will have happened?
It will be over, like Hamlet.
Do you remember?
Act One, scene three,
he finds out his uncle killed his father.
He keeps on going up
to his uncle and almost killing him.
And then he backs away,
he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
The critics sitting in the back row there,
they have to have an opinion,
so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."
Or they say, "Hamlet has
an Oedipus complex."
No, otherwise the play
would be over, stupid.
 
()
 
That's why Shakespeare puts
all that stuff in Hamlet --
Ophelia going mad,
the play within the play,
and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
That's in order to delay --
until Act Five, he can kill him.
 
It's the same with the Chopin.
He's just about to reach the E,
and he says, "Oops, better
go back up and do it again."
So he does it again.
Now, he gets excited.
 
(Music)
 
That's excitement, don't worry about it.
Now, he gets to F-sharp,
and finally he goes down to E,
but it's the wrong chord --
because the chord
he's looking for is this one,
and instead he does ...
Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,
because it deceives us.
I tell my students,
"If you have a deceptive cadence,
raise your eyebrows,
and everybody will know."
 
()
 
()
 
Right.
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
Now, he tries E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries the E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries E again,
and that doesn't work.
And then finally ...
There was a gentleman
in the front row who went, "Mmm."
 
()
 
It's the same gesture
he makes when he comes home
after a long day, turns off
the key in his car and says,
"Aah, I'm home."
Because we all know where home is.
 
So this is a piece which goes
from away to home.
I'm going to play it all the way through
and you're going to follow.
B, C, B, C, B, C, B --
down to A, down to G, down to F.
Almost goes to E, but otherwise
the play would be over.
He goes back up to B,
he gets very excited.
Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.
It's the wrong chord.
It's the wrong chord.
And finally goes to E, and it's home.
And what you're going to see
is one-buttock playing.
 
()
 
Because for me, to join the B to the E,
I have to stop thinking
about every single note along the way,
and start thinking about the long,
long line from B to E.
 
You know, we were just in South Africa,
and you can't go to South Africa
without thinking of Mandela
in jail for 27 years.
What was he thinking about? Lunch?
No, he was thinking
about the vision for South Africa
and for human beings.
This is about vision.
This is about the long line.
Like the bird who flies over the field
and doesn't care about the fences
underneath, all right?
So now, you're going to follow
the line all the way from B to E.
And I've one last request before I play
this piece all the way through.
Would you think of somebody who you adore,
who's no longer there?
A beloved grandmother, a lover --
somebody in your life
who you love with all your heart,
but that person is no longer with you.
Bring that person into your mind,
and at the same time,
follow the line all the way from B to E,
and you'll hear everything
that Chopin had to say.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
()
 
Now, you may be wondering --
 
()
 
( ends)
 
You may be wondering why I'm clapping.
Well, I did this at a school in Boston
with about 70 seventh
graders, 12-year-olds.
I did exactly what I did with you,
and I explained the whole thing.
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.
I was clapping. They were clapping.
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"
And one of them said,
"Because we were listening."
 
()
 
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,
involved in all sorts of different things,
listening, understanding and being moved
by a piece by Chopin.
Now, that is something.
Am I sure that every single
person followed that,
understood it, was moved by it?
Of course, I can't be sure.
 
But I'll tell you what happened
to me in Ireland
during the Troubles, 10 years ago,
and I was working with some Catholic
and Protestant kids
on conflict resolution.
And I did this with them --
a risky thing to do,
because they were street kids.
And one of them came to me
the next morning
and he said,
"You know, I've never listened
to classical music in my life,
but when you played
that shopping piece ..."
 
()
 
He said, "My brother was shot last year
and I didn't cry for him.
But last night,
when you played that piece,
he was the one I was thinking about.
And I felt the tears
streaming down my face.
And it felt really
good to cry for my brother."
So I made up my mind at that moment
that classical music is for everybody.
Everybody.
 
Now, how would you walk --
my profession, the music profession
doesn't see it that way.
They say three percent of the population
likes classical music.
If only we could move it to four percent,
our problems would be over.
 
()
 
How would you walk?
How would you talk? How would you be?
If you thought, "Three percent
of the population likes classical music,
if only we could move it to four percent."
How would you walk or talk?
How would you be?
If you thought, "Everybody
loves classical music --
they just haven't found out about it yet."
See, these are totally different worlds.
 
Now, I had an amazing experience.
I was 45 years old,
I'd been conducting for 20 years,
and I suddenly had a realization.
The conductor of an orchestra
doesn't make a sound.
My picture appears
on the front of the CD --
 
()
 
But the conductor doesn't make a sound.
He depends, for his power,
on his ability to make
other people powerful.
And that changed everything for me.
It was totally life-changing.
People in my orchestra said,
"Ben, what happened?"
That's what happened.
I realized my job was to awaken
possibility in other people.
And of course, I wanted to know
whether I was doing that.
How do you find out?
You look at their eyes.
If their eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.
You could light up a village
with this guy's eyes.
 
()
 
Right. So if the eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.
If the eyes are not shining,
you get to ask a question.
And this is the question:
who am I being
that my players' eyes are not shining?
We can do that with our children, too.
Who am I being,
that my children's eyes are not shining?
That's a totally different world.
 
Now, we're all about to end
this magical, on-the-mountain week,
we're going back into the world.
And I say, it's appropriate
for us to ask the question,
who are we being as we go back
out into the world?
And you know, I have
a definition of success.
For me, it's very simple.
It's not about wealth and fame and power.
It's about how many shining eyes
I have around me.
 
So now, I have one last thought,
which is that it really makes
a difference what we say --
the words that come out of our mouth.
I learned this from a woman
who survived Auschwitz,
one of the rare survivors.
She went to Auschwitz
when she was 15 years old.
And ...
And her brother was eight,
and the parents were lost.
And she told me this, she said,
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,
and I looked down and saw
my brother's shoes were missing.
I said, 'Why are you so stupid,
can't you keep your things together
for goodness' sake?'"
The way an elder sister might speak
to a younger brother.
Unfortunately, it was the last
thing she ever said to him,
because she never saw him again.
He did not survive.
And so when she came out
of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
She told me this.
She said, "I walked out
of Auschwitz into life
and I made a vow.
And the vow was,
"I will never say anything that couldn't
stand as the last thing I ever say."
Now, can we do that? No.
And we'll make ourselves wrong
and others wrong.
But it is a possibility to live into.
 
Thank you.
 
()
 
Shining eyes.
 
()
 
Shining eyes.
 
()
 
Thank you, thank you.
 
So, I guess it is a result
of globalization
that you can find Coca-Cola tins
on top of Everest
and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.
 
()
 
And so I just came,
two days ago, from the Himalayas
to your kind invitation.
So I would like to invite you, also,
for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.
And to show the place
where meditators, like me,
who began with being a molecular biologist
in Pasteur Institute,
and found their way to the mountains.
 
So these are a few images
I was lucky to take and be there.
There's Mount Kailash
in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.
This is from Marlboro country.
 
()
 
This is a turquoise lake.
A meditator.
This is the hottest day of the year
somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.
And the night before, we camped,
and my Tibetan friends said,
"We are going to sleep outside."
And I said, "Why? We have
enough space in the tent."
They said, "Yes, but it's summertime."
 
()
 
So now, we are going
to speak of happiness.
As a Frenchman, I must say
that there are
a lot of French intellectuals
that think happiness
is not at all interesting.
 
()
 
I just wrote an essay on happiness,
and there was a controversy.
And someone wrote an article saying,
"Don't impose on us
the dirty work of happiness."
 
()
 
"We don't care about being happy.
We need to live with passion.
We like the ups and downs of life.
We like our suffering because it's so good
when it ceases for a while."
 
()
 
This is what I see from the balcony
of my hermitage in the Himalayas.
It's about two meters by three,
and you are all welcome any time.
 
()
 
Now, let's come
to happiness or well-being.
And first of all, you know,
despite what the French intellectuals say,
it seems that no one wakes up
in the morning thinking,
"May I suffer the whole day?"
 
()
 
Which means that somehow,
consciously or not,
directly or indirectly,
in the short or the long term,
whatever we do, whatever we hope,
whatever we dream --
somehow, is related to a deep, profound
desire for well-being or happiness.
As Pascal said,
even the one who hangs himself,
somehow, is looking
for cessation of suffering.
He finds no other way.
But then, if you look
in the literature, East and West,
you can find incredible diversity
of definition of happiness.
Some people say, I only believed
in remembering the past,
imagining the future, never the present.
Some people say happiness is right now;
it's the quality of the freshness
of the present moment.
And that led Henri Bergson,
the French philosopher, to say,
"All the great thinkers of humanity
have left happiness in the vague
so that each of them
could define their own terms."
 
Well, that would be fine if it was just
a secondary preoccupation in life.
But now, if it is something
that is going to determine
the quality of every instant of our life,
then we better know what it is,
have some clearer idea.
And probably, the fact
that we don't know that is why, so often,
although we seek happiness,
it seems we turn our back to it.
Although we want to avoid suffering,
it seems we are running
somewhat towards it.
And that can also come
from some kind of confusions.
 
One of the most common ones
is happiness and pleasure.
But if you look at
the characteristics of those two,
pleasure is contingent upon time,
upon its object,
upon the place.
It is something that -- changes of nature.
Beautiful chocolate cake:
first serving is delicious,
second one not so much,
then we feel disgust.
 
()
 
That's the nature of things.
We get tired.
I used to be a fan of Bach.
I used to play it on the guitar, you know.
I can hear it two, three, five times.
If I had to hear it 24 hours,
non-stop, it might be very tiring.
If you are feeling very cold,
you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.
After some moments,
you just go a little back,
and then it starts burning.
It sort of uses itself
as you experience it.
And also, again, it can --
also, it's something that you --
it is not something
that is radiating outside.
Like, you can feel intense pleasure
and some others around you
can be suffering a lot.
 
Now, what, then, will be happiness?
And happiness, of course, is such
a vague word, so let's say well-being.
And so, I think the best definition,
according to the Buddhist view,
is that well-being is not just
a mere pleasurable sensation.
It is a deep sense
of serenity and fulfillment.
A state that actually pervades
and underlies all emotional states,
and all the joys and sorrows
that can come one's way.
For you, that might be surprising.
Can we have this kind of well-being
while being sad?
In a way, why not?
Because we are speaking
of a different level.
 
Look at the waves coming near the shore.
When you are at the bottom
of the wave, you hit the bottom.
You hit the solid rock.
When you are surfing on the top,
you are all elated.
So you go from elation
to depression -- there's no depth.
Now, if you look at the high sea,
there might be beautiful,
calm ocean, like a mirror.
There might be storms,
but the depth of the ocean
is still there, unchanged.
So now, how is that?
It can only be a state of being,
not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.
Even joy -- that can be
the spring of happiness.
But there's also wicked joy,
you can rejoice in someone's suffering.
 
So how do we proceed
in our quest for happiness?
Very often, we look outside.
We think that if we could gather
this and that, all the conditions,
something that we say,
"Everything to be happy --
to have everything to be happy."
That very sentence already reveals
the doom, destruction of happiness.
To have everything.
If we miss something, it collapses.
And also, when things go wrong,
we try to fix the outside so much,
but our control
of the outer world is limited,
temporary, and often, illusory.
So now, look at inner conditions.
Aren't they stronger?
Isn't it the mind that translates
the outer condition
into happiness and suffering?
And isn't that stronger?
We know, by experience,
that we can be
what we call "a little paradise,"
and yet, be completely unhappy within.
 
The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,
and there was a lot of construction
going on everywhere.
So one evening, he said,
"Look, you are doing all these things,
but isn't it nice, also,
to build something within?"
And he said, "[Without] that --
even if you get a high-tech flat
on the 100th floor of a super-modern
and comfortable building,
if you are deeply unhappy within,
all you are going to look for
is a window from which to jump."
So now, at the opposite,
we know a lot of people who,
in very difficult circumstances,
manage to keep serenity, inner strength,
inner freedom, confidence.
So now, if the inner conditions
are stronger --
of course, the outer
conditions do influence,
and it's wonderful to live
longer, healthier,
to have access to information, education,
to be able to travel, to have freedom.
It's highly desirable.
However, this is not enough.
Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.
The experience that translates
everything is within the mind.
So then, when we ask oneself
how to nurture
the condition for happiness,
the inner conditions, and which are those
which will undermine happiness.
So then, this just needs
to have some experience.
 
We have to know from ourselves,
there are certain states of mind
that are conducive to this flourishing,
to this well-being,
what the Greeks called
eudaimonia, flourishing.
There are some which are adverse
to this well-being.
And so, if we look
from our own experience,
anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,
obsessive desire, strong grasping,
they don't leave us in such a good state
after we have experienced it.
And also, they are detrimental
to others' happiness.
So we may consider that the more
those are invading our mind,
and, like a chain reaction,
the more we feel miserable,
we feel tormented.
At the opposite,
everyone knows deep within
that an act of selfless generosity,
if from the distance, without anyone
knowing anything about it,
we could save a child's life,
make someone happy.
We don't need the recognition.
We don't need any gratitude.
Just the mere fact of doing that
fills such a sense of adequation
with our deep nature.
And we would like to be
like that all the time.
 
So is that possible,
to change our way of being,
to transform one's mind?
Aren't those negative emotions,
or destructive emotions,
inherent to the nature of mind?
Is change possible in our emotions,
in our traits, in our moods?
For that we have to ask,
what is the nature of mind?
And if we look from
the experiential point of view,
there is a primary
quality of consciousness
that's just the mere fact
to be cognitive, to be aware.
Consciousness is like a mirror
that allows all images to rise on it.
You can have ugly faces,
beautiful faces in the mirror.
The mirror allows that,
but the mirror is not tainted,
is not modified,
is not altered by those images.
Likewise, behind every single thought
there is the bare consciousness,
pure awareness.
This is the nature.
It cannot be tainted intrinsically
with hatred or jealousy because then,
if it was always there --
like a dye that would permeate
the whole cloth --
then it would be found
all the time, somewhere.
We know we're not always angry,
always jealous, always generous.
 
So, because the basic
fabric of consciousness
is this pure cognitive quality
that differentiates it from a stone,
there is a possibility for change
because all emotions are fleeting.
That is the ground for mind training.
Mind training is based on the idea
that two opposite mental factors
cannot happen at the same time.
You could go from love to hate.
But you cannot, at the same time,
toward the same object,
the same person, want to harm
and want to do good.
You cannot, in the same gesture,
shake hand and give a blow.
So, there are natural
antidotes to emotions
that are destructive
to our inner well-being.
So that's the way to proceed.
Rejoicing compared to jealousy.
A kind of sense of inner freedom
as opposite to intense
grasping and obsession.
Benevolence, loving kindness
against hatred.
But, of course, each emotion then
would need a particular antidote.
 
Another way is to try to find
a general antidote to all emotions,
and that's by looking at the very nature.
Usually, when we feel annoyed,
hatred or upset with someone,
or obsessed with something,
the mind goes again
and again to that object.
Each time it goes to the object,
it reinforces that obsession
or that annoyance.
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.
So what we need to look for now is,
instead of looking outward,
we look inward.
Look at anger itself.
It looks very menacing,
like a billowing monsoon cloud
or thunderstorm.
We think we could sit on the cloud,
but if you go there, it's just mist.
Likewise, if you look
at the thought of anger,
it will vanish like frost
under the morning sun.
If you do this again
and again, the propensity,
the tendencies for anger to arise again
will be less and less
each time you dissolve it.
And, at the end, although it may rise,
it will just cross the mind,
like a bird crossing the sky
without leaving any track.
So this is the principal of mind training.
 
Now, it takes time,
because it took time for all those faults
in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,
so it will take time
to unfold them as well.
But that's the only way to go.
Mind transformation --
that is the very meaning of meditation.
It means familiarization
with a new way of being,
new way of perceiving things,
which is more in adequation with reality,
with interdependence, with the stream
and continuous transformation,
which our being and our consciousness is.
 
So, the interface with cognitive science,
since we need to come to that,
it was, I suppose, the subject of --
we have to deal in such a short time --
with brain plasticity.
The brain was thought
to be more or less fixed.
All the nominal connections,
in numbers and quantities,
were thought, until the last 20 years,
to be more or less fixed
when we reached adult age.
Now, recently, it has been found
that it can change a lot.
A violinist, as we heard, who has done
10,000 hours of violin practice,
some area that controls the movements
of fingers in the brain changes a lot,
increasing reinforcement
of the synaptic connections.
So can we do that with human qualities?
With loving kindness,
with patience, with openness?
 
So that's what those great
meditators have been doing.
Some of them who came to the labs,
like in Madison, Wisconsin,
or in Berkeley,
did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.
They do, like, three years' retreat,
where they do meditate 12 hours a day.
And then, the rest of their life,
they will do three or four hours a day.
They are real Olympic
champions of mind training.
 
()
 
This is the place where the meditators --
you can see it's kind of inspiring.
Now, here with 256 electrodes.
 
()
 
So what did they find?
Of course, same thing.
The scientific embargo --
if it's ever submitted to "Nature,"
hopefully, it will be accepted.
It deals with the state of compassion,
unconditional compassion.
We asked meditators, who have
been doing that for years and years,
to put their mind in a state
where there's nothing but loving kindness,
total availability to sentient being.
Of course, during the training,
we do that with objects.
We think of people suffering,
of people we love,
but at some point, it can be
a state which is all pervading.
Here is the preliminary result,
which I can show
because it's already been shown.
The bell curve shows 150 controls,
and what is being looked at
is the difference between the right
and the left frontal lobe.
In very short, people
who have more activity
in the right side of the prefrontal cortex
are more depressed, withdrawn.
They don't describe
a lot of positive affect.
It's the opposite on the left side:
more tendency to altruism,
to happiness, to express,
and curiosity and so forth.
So there's a basic line for people.
And also, it can be changed.
If you see a comic movie,
you go off to the left side.
If you are happy about something,
you'll go more to the left side.
If you have a bout of depression,
you'll go to the right side.
Here, the -0.5 is the full
standard deviation
of a meditator
who meditated on compassion.
It's something that is totally out
of the bell curve.
 
So, I've no time to go
into all the different scientific results.
Hopefully, they will come.
But they found that --
this is after three and a half hours
in an fMRI,
it's like coming out of a space ship.
Also, it has been shown in other labs --
for instance,
Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --
that some meditators are able, also,
to control their emotional response
more than it could be thought.
Like the startle experiments, for example.
If you sit a guy on a chair
with all this apparatus
measuring your physiology,
and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,
it's such an instinctive response that,
in 20 years, they never saw
anyone who would not jump.
Some meditators,
without trying to stop it,
but simply by being completely open,
thinking that that bang is just going
to be a small event like a shooting star,
they are able not to move at all.
 
So the whole point of that is not,
sort of, to make, like,
a circus thing of showing exceptional
beings who can jump, or whatever.
It's more to say
that mind training matters.
That this is not just a luxury.
This is not a supplementary
vitamin for the soul.
This is something
that's going to determine
the quality of every instant of our lives.
We are ready to spend 15 years
achieving education.
We love to do jogging, fitness.
We do all kinds of things
to remain beautiful.
Yet, we spend surprisingly little time
taking care of what matters most --
the way our mind functions --
which, again, is the ultimate thing
that determines
the quality of our experience.
 
Now, compassion
is supposed to be put in action.
That's what we try to do
in different places.
Just this one example
is worth a lot of work.
This lady with bone TB,
left alone in a tent,
was going to die with her only daughter.
One year later, how she is.
Different schools and clinics
we've been doing in Tibet.
 
And just, I leave you
with the beauty of those looks
that tells more about happiness
than I could ever say.

And jumping monks of Tibet.

Flying monks.
 
Thank you very much.
 
Thank you.
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.
I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,
an ancient work from ancient India
in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people
come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,
and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.
All the young people, actually, from the city.
The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,
because when he came to their city he accepted --
he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,
and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,
raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.
 
So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:
"He's supposed to be religious and all this.
What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"
and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.
They wouldn't go listen to him.
But the young people all came.
And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.
And as soon as they had laid all these,
all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,
he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,
the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there
the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
 
And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets
with human life on it,
and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.
So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed
in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning
or rocks or flames or gases exploding.
They actually see landscapes and human beings
and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.
 
He made that special effect at the beginning
to get everyone to think about interconnection
and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,
and how we're all totally interconnected here,
and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,
we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.
And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.
And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,
if that's a modern form of enlightenment.
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness
of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,
of where everybody can really know everything
that's going on everywhere in the planet.
 
And therefore it will become intolerable --
what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,
totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying
the life of the mind or whatever it is,
and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease
and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,
or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.
It just becomes intolerable.
With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology
to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.
 
And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,
a little bit tired, we do suffer.
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way.
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,
but basically we all have this common misery
that we are sort of stuck inside our skins
and everyone else is out there.
And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin
and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,
and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.
 
Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --
is that all we are is what is inside our skin.
And it's inside and outside, self and other,
and other is all very different.
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,
a little bit, right?
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,
but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,
you'd freak out.
What do they want from me? Like, who's that?
And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person
because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.
Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,
and everyone else is different,
then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?
Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?
Who's going to get enough out of the world?
Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --
if you're different from all the other beings?
 
So where compassion comes is where you
surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:
through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,
knowing that you have no such boundary,
knowing your interconnectedness with other beings.
You can experience yourself as the other beings
when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.
When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --
but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said
in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?
How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.
I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.
I need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.
It would be terrible.
 
But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.
When you're no longer locked in yourself,
and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge
of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,
and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,
and realizing that you are the other being,
somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,
you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,
like the Beatles used to sing.
 
You know, we really learned everything in the '60s.
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,
and they've been trying to suppress it since then.
I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.
But when we're relieved from that,
we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.
And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.
It's totally strange.
The Dalai Lama always likes to say --
he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,
it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures
are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.
It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --
and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.
Like, even when you're having a good time,
when is the good time over?
The good time is over when you think, how good is it?
And then it's never good enough.
 
I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly
on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,
doing it by having a good time.
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.
He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;
he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,
they went and took everything away from the haves.
You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.
They took it all away by violence,
saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.
They didn't help at all.
 
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?
And so then he looks at me.
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"
was all I could think of. What is virtue?
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion
is that it is more fun.
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.
Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,
and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.
Even though his people are being genocided --
and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,
in every Chinese prison. He feels it.
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.
I won't even say what they do. But he feels it.
And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.
 
Because when you open up like that,
then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,
how it can be changed.
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.
She scared us with the lava man is coming,
then the tsunami is coming,
but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.
It's really lovely.
 
So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,
and the human being actually is compassion.
The human being is almost out of time.
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for?
Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.
He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.
And he would have tremendous fun doing that.
 
So the first person who gets happy,
when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,
where you're always dissatisfied --
as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.
I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.
I'm going to get up in the morning and think,
what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,
my pet, my butterfly?"
And the first person who gets happy when you do that,
you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,
because your whole perception broadens
and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.
And you realize that this -- being with these people --
is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.
It is Nirvana.
And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.
Thank you.
