Vincent Moon: How can we use computers,
cameras, microphones to represent the world
in an alternative way,
as much as possible?
How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet
to create a new form of cinema?
And actually, why do we record?
 
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind
that I started to make films 10 years ago,
first with a friend, Christophe Abric.
He had a website, La Blogothèque,
dedicated to independent music.
We were crazy about music.
We wanted to represent 
music in a different way,
to film the music we love,
the musicians we admired,
as much as possible, far 
from the music industry
and far from the cliches attached to it.
We started to publish every week
sessions on the Internet.
We are going to see a few extracts now.
 
From Grizzly Bear in the shower
to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.
From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower
to Tom Jones in his 
hotel room in New York.
From Arcade Fire in an elevator
in the Olympia
to Beirut going down
a staircase in Brooklyn.
From R.E.M. in a car
to The National around a table at night
in the south of France.
From Bon Iver playing with some friends
in an apartment in Montmartre
to Yeasayer having a long night,
and many, many, many more
unknown or very famous bands.
 
We published all those films
for free on the Internet,
and we wanted to share
all those films and represent music
in a different way.
We wanted to create 
another type of intimacy
using all those new technologies.
At the time, 10 years ago actually,
there was no such project on the Internet,
and I guess that's why the project we 
were making, the Take Away Shows,
got quite successful,
reaching millions of viewers.
 
After a while, I got a bit —
I wanted to go somewhere else.
I felt the need to travel and
to discover some other music,
to explore the world,
going to other corners,
and actually it was also
this idea of nomadic cinema,
sort of, that I had in mind.
How could the use of new technologies 
and the road fit together?
How could I edit my films in a bus
crossing the Andes?
So I went on five-year travels
around the globe.
I started at the time in the digital film 
and music label collection Petites Planètes,
which was also an homage to
French filmmaker Chris Marker.
We're going to see now a few more extracts
of those new films.
 
From the tecno brega diva of
northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos
to a female ensemble in Chechnya.
From experimental electronic music 
in Singapore with One Man Nation
to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing
on his rooftop in São Paolo.
From The Bambir, the great 
rock band from Armenia
to some traditional songs
in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.
From White Shoes, a great retro 
pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia
to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary 
band from Kiev, Ukraine.
From Tomi Lebrero
and his bandoneon and his friends
in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
to many other places
and musicians around the world.
 
My desire was to make it as a trek.
To do all those films,
it would have been impossible
with a big company behind me,
with a structure or anything.
I was traveling alone with a backpack —
computer, camera, microphones in it.
Alone, actually, but 
just with local people,
meeting my team, which was absolutely not
professional people, on the spot there,
going from one place to another
and to make cinema as a trek.
I really believed that cinema could be
this very simple thing:
I want to make a film and you're going 
to give me a place to stay for the night.
I give you a moment of cinema
and you offer me a capirinha.
Well, or other drinks,
depending on where you are.
 
In Peru, they drink pisco sour.
Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually,
I had no idea about what I would do there.
And I just had one phone number, actually,
of one person.
Three months later,
after traveling all around the 
country, I had recorded 33 films,
only with the help of local people,
only with the help of people
that I was asking all the 
time the same question:
What is important to record here today?
By living in such a way,
by working without any structure,
I was able to react to the moment
and to decide, oh, this is 
important to make now.
This is important to 
record that whole person.
This is important to create this exchange.
When I went to Chechnya,
the first person I met
looked at me and was like,
"What are you doing here?
Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics?
What kind of problems 
are you going to study?"
Well, I was there to research
on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually —
incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,
which is absolutely unknown 
outside of the region.
As soon as people understood
that I would give them those films —
I would publish them online for free
under a Creative Commons license,
but I would also really 
give them to the people
and I would let them do 
what they want with it.
I just want to represent 
them in a beautiful light.
I just want to portray them in a way that
their grandchildren are going
to look at their grandfather,
and they're going to be like,
"Whoa, my grandfather is as 
cool as Beyoncé." ()
It's a really important thing.
()
 
It's really important,
because that's the way
people are going to look differently at 
their own culture, at their own land.
They're going to think about it differently.
It may be a way to maintain 
a certain diversity.
Why you will record?
Hmm. There's a really good quote
by American thinker Hakim Bey
which says, "Every recording
is a tombstone of a live performance."
It's a really good 
sentence to keep in mind
nowadays in an era saturated by images.
What's the point of that?
Where do we go with it?
I was researching. I was still 
keeping this idea in mind:
What's the point?
I was researching on music, trying to pull,
trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.
Where is this all coming from?
I am French. I had no idea about
what I would discover, 
which is a very simple thing:
Everything was sacred, at first,
and music was spiritual healing.
How could I use my camera,
my little tool, to get closer
and maybe not only capture the trance
but find an equivalent, 
a cine-trance, maybe,
something in complete harmony
with the people?
 
That is now my new research I'm doing
on spirituality, on new 
spirits around the world.
Maybe a few more extracts now.
From the Tana Toraja 
funeral ritual in Indonesia
to an Easter ceremony 
in the north of Ethiopia.
From jathilan, a popular trance ritual
on the island of Java,
to Umbanda in the north of Brazil.
The Sufi rituals of Chechnya
to a mass in the holiest 
church of Armenia.
Some Sufi songs in Harar,
the holy city of Ethiopia,
to an ayahuasca ceremony
deep in the Amazon of 
Peru with the Shipibo.
Then to my new project, 
the one I'm doing now
here in Brazil, named "Híbridos."
I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.
It's research on the new 
spiritualities all around the country.
This is my quest, my own little quest 
of what I call experimental ethnography,
trying to hybrid all 
those different genres,
trying to regain a certain complexity.
 
Why do we record?
I was still there.
I really believe cinema teaches us to see.
The way we show the world
is going to change the 
way we see this world,
and we live in a moment where the mass media
are doing a terrible, terrible job
at representing the world:
violence, extremists,
only spectacular events,
only simplifications of everyday life.
I think we are recording
to regain a certain complexity.
To reinvent life today,
we have to make new forms of images.
And it's very simple.
 
Muito obrigado.

Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.
Merci. We have to prepare for
the following performance,
and I have a question for you,
and the question is this:
You show up in places like the 
ones you just have shown us,
and you are carrying a camera
and I assume that you are welcome
but you are not always absolutely welcome.
You walk into sacred rituals,
private moments in a village, a town,
a group of people.
How do you break the barrier
when you show up with a lens?
 
VM: I think you break it with your body,
more than with your knowledge.
That's what it taught me to travel,
to trust the memory of the body
more than the memory of the brain.
The respect is stepping forward,
not stepping backward, and I really think that
by engaging your body in the
moment, in the ceremony,
in the places, people welcome you
and understand your energy.
 
BG: You told me that most of the videos
you have made are 
actually one single shot.
You don't do much editing.
I mean, you edited the ones for us
at the beginning of the sessions
because of the length, etc.
Otherwise, you just go in and capture
whatever happens in front of your eyes
without much planning, and so is that the case?
It's correct?
 
VM: My idea is that I think that
as long as we don't cut, in a way,
as long as we let the viewer watch,
more and more viewers 
are going to feel closer,
are going to get closer to the moment,
to that moment and to that place.
I really think of that as a matter 
of respecting the viewer,
to not cut all the time from one place to another,
to just let the time go.
 
BG: Tell me in a few words 
about your new project,
"Híbridos," here in Brazil.
Just before coming to 
TEDGlobal, you have actually
been traveling around 
the country for that.
Tell us a couple of things.
 
VM: "Híbridos" is — 
I really believe Brazil,
far from the cliches, is the greatest
religious country in the world,
the greatest country 
in terms of spirituality
and in experimentations in spiritualities.
And it's a big project I'm 
doing over this year,
which is researching in very
different regions of Brazil,
in very different forms of cults,
and trying to understand 
how people live together
with spirituality nowadays.
 
BG: The man who is going to 
appear onstage momentarily,
and Vincent's going to introduce him,
is one of the subjects of 
one of his past videos.
When did you do a video with him?
 
VM: I guess four years ago,
four years in my first travel.
 
BG: So it was one of 
your first ones in Brazil.
VM: It was amongst the 
first ones in Brazil, yeah.
I shot the film in Recife,
in the place where he is from.
 
BG: So let's introduce him. 
Who are we waiting for?
 
VM: I'll just make it very short.
It's a very great honor for 
me to welcome onstage
one of the greatest Brazilian 
musicians of all time.
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos.
 
BG: Naná Vasconcelos!

Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle.

My job is to design, build and study
robots that communicate with people.
But this story doesn't start with robotics
at all, it starts with animation.
When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"
I was amazed by how much
emotion they could put
into something as trivial as a desk lamp.
I mean, look at them --
at the end of this movie,
you actually feel something
for two pieces of furniture.
 
()
 
And I said, I have
to learn how to do this.
So I made a really bad career decision.
 
()
 
And that's what my mom
was like when I did it.
 
()
 
I left a very cozy tech job in Israel
at a nice software company
and I moved to New York
to study animation.
And there I lived
in a collapsing apartment building
in Harlem with roommates.
I'm not using this phrase
metaphorically --
the ceiling actually collapsed
one day in our living room.
Whenever they did news stories
about building violations in New York,
they would put the report
in front of our building,
as kind of, like, a backdrop
to show how bad things are.
 
Anyway, during the day, I went to school
and at night I would sit and draw
frame by frame of pencil animation.
And I learned two surprising lessons.
One of them was that
when you want to arouse emotions,
it doesn't matter so much
how something looks;
it's all in the motion, in the timing
of how the thing moves.
And the second was something
one of our teachers told us.
He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."
And he said, "As an animator,
you're not a director -- you're an actor."
So, if you want to find
the right motion for a character,
don't think about it --
go use your body to find it.
Stand in front of a mirror,
act it out in front of a camera --
whatever you need -- and then
put it back in your character.
 
A year later I found myself at MIT
in the Robotic Life Group.
It was one of the first groups
researching the relationships
between humans and robots.
And I still had this dream
to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.
But I found that robots didn't move
at all in this engaging way
that I was used to
from my animation studies.
Instead, they were all --
how should I put it --
they were all kind of robotic.
()
And I thought, what if I took
whatever I learned in animation school,
and used that to design
my robotic desk lamp.
So I went and designed frame by frame
to try to make this robot as graceful
and engaging as possible.
And here when you see the robot
interacting with me on a desktop --
and I'm actually redesigning the robot,
so, unbeknownst to itself,
it's kind of digging its own
grave by helping me.
 
()
 
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical
structure giving me light,
and more of a helpful,
kind of quiet apprentice
that's always there when you need it
and doesn't really interfere.
And when, for example, I'm looking
for a battery that I can't find,
in a subtle way, it'll show me
where the battery is.
So you can see my confusion here.
I'm not an actor.
And I want you to notice
how the same mechanical structure
can, at one point,
just by the way it moves,
seem gentle and caring
and in the other case,
seem violent and confrontational.
And it's the same structure,
just the motion is different.
Actor: "You want to know something?
Well, you want to know something?
He was already dead!
Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"
 
()
 
But, moving in a graceful way
is just one building block
of this whole structure
called human-robot interaction.
I was, at the time, doing my PhD,
I was working on human-robot teamwork,
teams of humans and robots
working together.
I was studying the engineering,
the psychology,
the philosophy of teamwork,
and at the same time,
I found myself in my own kind
of teamwork situation,
with a good friend of mine,
who's actually here.
And in that situation,
we can easily imagine robots
in the near future being there with us.
It was after a Passover Seder.
We were folding up
a lot of folding chairs,
and I was amazed at how quickly
we found our own rhythm.
Everybody did their own part,
we didn't have to divide our tasks.
We didn't have to communicate
verbally about this --
it all just happened.
 
And I thought, humans and robots
don't look at all like this.
When humans and robots interact,
it's much more like a chess game:
the human does a thing, the robot
analyzes whatever the human did,
the robot decides what to do next,
plans it and does it.
Then the human waits,
until it's their turn again.
So it's much more like a chess game,
and that makes sense,
because chess is great for mathematicians
and computer scientists.
It's all about information, analysis,
decision-making and planning.
 
But I wanted my robot
to be less of a chess player,
and more like a doer
that just clicks and works together.
So I made my second
horrible career choice:
I decided to study acting for a semester.
I took off from the PhD,
I went to acting classes.
I actually participated in a play --
I hope there’s no video
of that around still.
 
()
 
And I got every book
I could find about acting,
including one from the 19th century
that I got from the library.
And I was really amazed, because my name
was the second name on the list --
the previous name was in 1889.
 
()
 
And this book was
kind of waiting for 100 years
to be rediscovered for robotics.
And this book shows actors
how to move every muscle in the body
to match every kind of emotion
that they want to express.
 
But the real revelation was
when I learned about method acting.
It became very popular
in the 20th century.
And method acting said
you don't have to plan
every muscle in your body;
instead, you have to use your body
to find the right movement.
You have to use your sense memory
to reconstruct the emotions
and kind of think with your body
to find the right expression --
improvise, play off your scene partner.
And this came at the same time
as I was reading about this trend
in cognitive psychology,
called embodied cognition,
which also talks about the same ideas.
We use our bodies to think;
we don't just think with our brains
and use our bodies to move,
but our bodies feed back into our brain
to generate the way that we behave.
 
And it was like a lightning bolt.
I went back to my office,
I wrote this paper,
which I never really published,
called "Acting Lessons
for Artificial Intelligence."
And I even took another month
to do what was then the first theater play
with a human and a robot acting together.
That's what you saw
before with the actors.
And I thought:
How can we make an artificial
intelligence model --
a computer, computational model --
that will model some of these
ideas of improvisation,
of taking risks, of taking chances,
even of making mistakes?
Maybe it can make for better
robotic teammates.
So I worked for quite
a long time on these models
and I implemented them
on a number of robots.
 
Here you can see a very early example
with the robots trying to use
this embodied artificial intelligence
to try to match my movements
as closely as possible.
It's sort of like a game.
Let's look at it.
You can see when I psych
it out, it gets fooled.
And it's a little bit
like what you might see actors do
when they try to mirror each other
to find the right synchrony between them.
And then, I did another experiment,
and I got people off the street
to use the robotic desk lamp,
and try out this idea
of embodied artificial intelligence.
So, I actually used two kinds
of brains for the same robot.
 
The robot is the same lamp that you saw,
and I put two brains in it.
For one half of the people,
I put in a brain
that's kind of the traditional,
calculated robotic brain.
It waits for its turn,
it analyzes everything, it plans.
Let's call it the calculated brain.
The other got more the stage
actor, risk-taker brain.
Let's call it the adventurous brain.
It sometimes acts without knowing
everything it has to know.
It sometimes makes mistakes
and corrects them.
And I had them do this very tedious task
that took almost 20 minutes,
and they had to work together,
somehow simulating, like, a factory job
of repetitively doing the same thing.
What I found is that people
actually loved the adventurous robot.
They thought it was more intelligent,
more committed,
a better member of the team,
contributed to the success
of the team more.
They even called it "he" and "she,"
whereas people with the calculated brain
called it "it," and nobody
ever called it "he" or "she."
When they talked about it after the task,
with the adventurous brain,
they said, "By the end, we were good
friends and high-fived mentally."
Whatever that means.
 
()
 
Sounds painful.
Whereas the people
with the calculated brain
said it was just like a lazy apprentice.
It only did what it was supposed
to do and nothing more,
which is almost what people
expect robots to do,
so I was surprised that people
had higher expectations of robots
than what anybody in robotics
thought robots should be doing.
And in a way, I thought,
maybe it's time --
just like method acting
changed the way people thought
about acting in the 19th century,
from going from the very calculated,
planned way of behaving,
to a more intuitive, risk-taking,
embodied way of behaving --
maybe it's time for robots
to have the same kind of revolution.
 
A few years later, I was at my next
research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,
and I was working in a group
dealing with robotic musicians.
And I thought, music:
that's the perfect place
to look at teamwork, coordination,
timing, improvisation --
and we just got this robot
playing marimba.
And the marimba, for everybody like me,
it was this huge, wooden xylophone.
And when I was looking at this,
I looked at other works
in human-robot improvisation --
yes, there are other works
in human-robot improvisation --
and they were also a little bit
like a chess game.
The human would play,
the robot analyzed what was played,
and would improvise their own part.
So, this is what musicians called
a call-and-response interaction,
and it also fits very well
robots and artificial intelligence.
But I thought, if I use the same ideas
I used in the theater play
and in the teamwork studies,
maybe I can make the robots
jam together like a band.
Everybody's riffing off each other,
nobody is stopping for a moment.
And so I tried to do the same
things, this time with music,
where the robot doesn't really know
what it's about to play,
it just sort of moves its body
and uses opportunities to play,
and does what my jazz teacher
when I was 17 taught me.
She said, when you improvise,
sometimes you don't know
what you're doing, and you still do it.
So I tried to make a robot that doesn't
actually know what it's doing,
but is still doing it.
So let's look at a few seconds
from this performance,
where the robot listens
to the human musician
and improvises.
And then, look how the human
musician also responds
to what the robot is doing
and picking up from its behavior,
and at some point can even be surprised
by what the robot came up with.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
()
 
Being a musician
is not just about making notes,
otherwise nobody
would ever go see a live show.
Musicians also communicate
with their bodies,
with other band members,
with the audience,
they use their bodies
to express the music.
And I thought, we already have
a robot musician on stage,
why not make it be
a full-fledged musician?
And I started designing
a socially expressive head
for the robot.
The head doesn’t actually
touch the marimba,
it just expresses what the music is like.
These are some napkin sketches
from a bar in Atlanta
that was dangerously
located exactly halfway
between my lab and my home.
So I spent, I would say, on average,
three to four hours a day there.
I think.
 
()
 
And I went back to my animation
tools and tried to figure out
not just what a robotic
musician would look like,
but especially what a robotic
musician would move like,
to sort of show that it doesn't like
what the other person is playing --
and maybe show whatever beat
it's feeling at the moment.
 
So we ended up actually getting the money
to build this robot, which was nice.
I'm going to show you now
the same kind of performance,
this time with a socially expressive head.
And notice one thing --
how the robot is really showing us
the beat it's picking up from the human,
while also giving the human a sense
that the robot knows what it's doing.
And also how it changes the way it moves
as soon as it starts its own solo.
 
(Music)
 
Now it's looking at me,
showing that it's listening.
 
(Music)
 
Now look at the final chord
of the piece again.
And this time the robot
communicates with its body
when it's busy doing its own thing,
and when it's ready to coordinate
the final chord with me.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ending)
 
(Final chord)
 
()
 
Thanks.
I hope you see
how much this part of the body
that doesn't touch the instrument
actually helps
with the musical performance.
And at some point -- we are in Atlanta,
so obviously some rapper
will come into our lab at some point --
and we had this rapper come in and do
a little jam with the robot.
Here you can see the robot
basically responding to the beat.
Notice two things:
one, how irresistible it is to join
the robot while it's moving its head.
You kind of want to move
your own head when it does it.
And second, even though the rapper
is really focused on his iPhone,
as soon as the robot turns
to him, he turns back.
So even though it's just
in the periphery of his vision,
in the corner of his eye,
it's very powerful.
And the reason is that we can't ignore
physical things moving in our environment.
We are wired for that.
So if you have a problem --
maybe your partner is looking
at their iPhone or smartphone too much --
you might want to have a robot
there to get their attention.
 
()
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
()
 
Just to introduce the last robot
that we've worked on,
it came out of something
surprising that we found:
Some point people didn't care
about the robot being intelligent,
able to improvise and listen,
and do all these embodied intelligence
things that I spent years developing.
They really liked that the robot
was enjoying the music.
 
()
 
And they didn't say the robot
was moving to the music,
they said "enjoying" the music.
And we thought,
why don't we take this idea,
and I designed a new piece of furniture.
This time it wasn't a desk lamp,
it was a speaker dock,
one of those things
you plug your smartphone in.
And I thought,
what would happen if your speaker dock
didn't just play the music for you,
but would actually enjoy it, too?
And so again, here are some
animation tests from an early stage.
 
()
 
And this is what the final
product looked like.
 
(Music)
 
(Music ends)
 
So, a lot of bobbing heads.
 
()
 
A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,
so we can still see
robots influence people.
And it's not just fun and games.
 
I think one of the reasons I care so much
about robots that use
their body to communicate
and use their body to move is --
I'm going to let you in on a little
secret we roboticists are hiding --
is that every one of you
is going to be living with a robot
at some point in your life.
Somewhere in your future,
there will be a robot in your life.
If not in yours, your children's lives.
And I want these robots to be more fluent,
more engaging, more graceful
than currently they seem to be.
And for that I think maybe robots
need to be less like chess players
and more like stage actors
and more like musicians.
Maybe they should be able
to take chances and improvise.
Maybe they should be able
to anticipate what you're about to do.
Maybe they even need to be able
to make mistakes and correct them,
because in the end, we are human.
And maybe as humans,
robots that are a little less than perfect
are just perfect for us.
 
Thank you.
 
()
 
Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.
I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.
I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.
So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.
 
(Music)
 
()
 
Okay, so first of all,
let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,
()
Burniss Travis on the bass,
()
and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.
 
()
 
So the bandstand, as we call it,
this is an incredible space.
It is really a sacred space.
And one of the things that is really sacred about it
is that you have no opportunity to think about the future,
or the past.
You really are alive right here in this moment.
There are so many decisions being made
when you walk on the bandstand.
We had no idea what key we were going to play in.
In the middle, we sort of made our way
into a song called "Titi Boom."
But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.
Everyone's listening. We're responding.
You have no time for projected ideas.
 
So the idea of a mistake:
From the perspective of a jazz musician,
it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.
So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand --
first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.
The only mistake lies
in that I'm not able to perceive
what it is that someone else did.
Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.
So it's hard to even describe
what a funny note would be.
 
So for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,
that sounded like this ...
(Music)
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
(Music)
See, these are all right inside of the color palette.
If you played an E.
See, these all lie right inside
of this general emotional palette that we were painting.
If you played an F# though,
(Dissonance)
to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.
 
So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.
And we're going to play on this palette.
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.
And we won't react to it.
He'll introduce it for a second
and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.
We'll see what happens when we play with this palette.
 
(Music)
 
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.
The only way that I would say it was a mistake
is in that we didn't react to it.
It was an opportunity that was missed.
So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.
He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.
We'll all accept his ideas,
or not.
 
(Music)
 
So you see, he played this note.
I ended up creating a melody out of it.
The texture changed in the drums this time.
It got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense
in response to how I responded to it.
So there is no mistake.
The only mistake is if I'm not aware,
if each individual musician is not aware
and accepting enough of his fellow band member
to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.
 
So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.
It's a very purifying experience.
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.
We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance?
Well we're jazz musicians,
so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.

Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.
And the other dynamic of it
is that we don't micromanage in jazz.
You have some people who do.
But what that does
is it actually limits the artistic possibilities.
If I come up and I dictate to the band
that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,
and I just jump right in ...
ready, just play some time.
One, two, one, two, three, four.
(Music)
It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.
I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way."
 
If I really want the music to go there,
the best way for me to do it is to listen.
This is a science of listening.
It has far more to do with what I can perceive
than what it is that I can do.
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,
the first step for me is
to be patient, to listen to what's going on
and pull from something that's going on around me.
When you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians
and they give you more, and gradually it builds.
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.
 
(Music)
 
Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.
It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.
It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.
It's about being here in the moment,
accepting one another
and allowing creativity to flow.
 
Thank you.
