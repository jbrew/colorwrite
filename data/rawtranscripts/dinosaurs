How do you find a dinosaur?
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?
It's not.
And the answer relies on a formula
that all paleontologists use.
And I'm going to tell you the secret.
 
First, find rocks of the right age.
Second, those rocks
must be sedimentary rocks.
And third, layers of those rocks
must be naturally exposed.
That's it.
Find those three things
and get yourself on the ground,
chances are good
that you will find fossils.
 
Now let me break down this formula.
Organisms exist only during certain
geological intervals.
So you have to find
rocks of the right age,
depending on what your interests are.
If you want to find trilobites,
you have to find the really,
really old rocks of the Paleozoic --
rocks between a half a billion
and a quarter-billion years old.
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,
don't look in the Paleozoic,
you won't find them.
They hadn't evolved yet.
You have to find the younger
rocks of the Mesozoic,
and in the case of dinosaurs,
between 235 and 66 million years ago.
 
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks
of the right age at this point,
because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,
geologically mapped.
This is hard-won information.
The annals of Earth history
are written in rocks,
one chapter upon the next,
such that the oldest pages are on bottom
and the youngest on top.
 
Now, were it quite that easy,
geologists would rejoice.
It's not.
The library of Earth is an old one.
It has no librarian to impose order.
Operating over vast swaths of time,
myriad geological processes
offer every possible insult
to the rocks of ages.
Most pages are destroyed
soon after being written.
Some pages are overwritten,
creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests
of long-gone landscapes.
Pages that do find sanctuary
under the advancing sands of time
are never truly safe.
Unlike the Moon --
our dead, rocky companion --
the Earth is alive, pulsing
with creative and destructive forces
that power its geological metabolism.
Lunar rocks brought back
by the Apollo astronauts
all date back to about the age
of the Solar System.
Moon rocks are forever.
Earth rocks, on the other hand,
face the perils of a living lithosphere.
All will suffer ruination,
through some combination
of mutilation, compression,
folding, tearing, scorching and baking.
 
Thus, the volumes of Earth history
are incomplete and disheveled.
The library is vast and magnificent --
but decrepit.
And it was this tattered complexity
in the rock record
that obscured its meaning
until relatively recently.
Nature provided no card catalog
for geologists --
this would have to be invented.
Five thousand years after the Sumerians
learned to record their thoughts
on clay tablets,
the Earth's volumes remained
inscrutable to humans.
We were geologically illiterate,
unaware of the antiquity
of our own planet
and ignorant of our connection
to deep time.
 
It wasn't until the turn
of the 19th century
that our blinders were removed,
first, with the publication
of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"
in which he told us that the Earth
reveals no vestige of a beginning
and no prospect of an end;
and then, with the printing
of William Smith's map of Britain,
the first country-scale geological map,
giving us for the first time
predictive insight into where
certain types of rocks might occur.
After that, you could say things like,
"If we go over there,
we should be in the Jurassic,"
or, "If we go up over that hill,
we should find the Cretaceous."
 
So now, if you want to find trilobites,
get yourself a good geological map
and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,
find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.
Now of course, you can only make
a fossil in a sedimentary rock,
a rock made by sand and mud.
You can't have a fossil
in an igneous rock formed
by magma, like a granite,
or in a metamorphic rock
that's been heated and squeezed.
And you have to get yourself in a desert.
It's not that dinosaurs
particularly lived in deserts;
they lived on every land mass
and in every imaginable environment.
It's that you need to go to a place
that's a desert today,
a place that doesn't have
too many plants covering up the rocks,
and a place where erosion is always
exposing new bones at the surface.
So find those three things:
rocks of the right age,
that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,
and get yourself on the ground,
and you literally walk
until you see a bone
sticking out of the rock.
 
Here's a picture that I took
in Southern Patagonia.
Every pebble that you see
on the ground there
is a piece of dinosaur bone.
So when you're in that right situation,
it's not a question of whether
you'll find fossils or not;
you're going to find fossils.
The question is: Will you find something
that is scientifically significant?
And to help with that, I'm going to add
a fourth part to our formula,
which is this:
get as far away from other
paleontologists as possible.
 
()
 
It's not that I don't like
other paleontologists.
When you go to a place
that's relatively unexplored,
you have a much better chance
of not only finding fossils
but of finding something
that's new to science.
So that's my formula
for finding dinosaurs,
and I've applied it all around the world.
 
In the austral summer of 2004,
I went to the bottom of South America,
to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,
to prospect for dinosaurs:
a place that had terrestrial
sedimentary rocks of the right age,
in a desert,
a place that had been barely visited
by paleontologists.
And we found this.
This is a femur, a thigh bone,
of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.
That bone is 2.2 meters across.
That's over seven feet long.
 
Now, unfortunately,
that bone was isolated.
We dug and dug and dug,
and there wasn't another bone around.
But it made us hungry to go back
the next year for more.
And on the first day
of that next field season,
I found this: another two-meter femur,
only this time not isolated,
this time associated with 145 other bones
of a giant plant eater.
And after three more hard,
really brutal field seasons,
the quarry came to look like this.
And there you see the tail
of that great beast wrapping around me.
The giant that lay in this grave,
the new species of dinosaur,
we would eventually call
"Dreadnoughtus schrani."
Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet
from snout to tail.
It stood two-and-a-half stories
at the shoulder,
and all fleshed out in life,
it weighed 65 tons.
People ask me sometimes,
"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"
That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.
 
Now, one of the really cool things
about being a paleontologist
is when you find a new species,
you get to name it.
And I've always thought it a shame
that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs
are too often portrayed as passive,
lumbering platters of meat
on the landscape.
 
()
 
They're not.
Big herbivores can be surly,
and they can be territorial --
you do not want to mess with a hippo
or a rhino or a water buffalo.
The bison in Yellowstone injure
far more people than do the grizzly bears.
So can you imagine a big bull,
65-ton Dreadnoughtus
in the breeding season,
defending a territory?
That animal would have been
incredibly dangerous,
a menace to all around, and itself
would have had nothing to fear.
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"
or, "fears nothing."
 
Now, to grow so large,
an animal like Dreadnoughtus
would've had to have been
a model of efficiency.
That long neck and long tail help it
radiate heat into the environment,
passively controlling its temperature.
And that long neck also serves
as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.
Dreadnoughtus could stand
in one place and with that neck
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,
taking in tens of thousands of calories
while expending very few.
And these animals evolved
a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,
giving them immense stability,
because when you're 65 tons,
when you're literally as big as a house,
the penalty for falling over
is death.
Yeah, these animals are big and tough,
but they won't take a blow like that.
Dreadnoughtus falls over,
ribs break and pierce lungs.
Organs burst.
If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,
you don't get to fall down
in life -- even once.
 
Now, after this particular
Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried
and de-fleshed by a multitude
of bacteria, worms and insects,
its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,
exchanging molecules with the groundwater
and becoming more and more
like the entombing rock.
As layer upon layer
of sediment accumulated,
pressure from all sides
weighed in like a stony glove
whose firm and enduring grip held
each bone in a stabilizing embrace.
 
And then came the long ...
nothing.
Epoch after epoch of sameness,
nonevents without number.
All the while, the skeleton lay
everlasting and unchanging
in perfect equilibrium
within its rocky grave.
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.
The dinosaurs would reign
for another 12 million years
before their hegemony was snuffed out
in a fiery apocalypse.
The continents drifted. The mammals rose.
The Ice Age came.
 
And then, in East Africa,
an unpromising species of ape
evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.
These brainy primates were not
particularly fast or strong.
But they excelled at covering ground,
and in a remarkable diaspora
surpassing even the dinosaurs' record
of territorial conquest,
they dispersed across the planet,
ravishing every ecosystem
they encountered,
along the way, inventing culture
and metalworking and painting
and dance and music
and science
and rocket ships that would eventually
take 12 particularly excellent apes
to the surface of the Moon.
 
With seven billion peripatetic
Homo sapiens on the planet,
it was perhaps inevitable
that one of them would eventually
trod on the grave of the magnificent titan
buried beneath the badlands
of Southern Patagonia.
I was that ape.
And standing there, alone in the desert,
it was not lost on me
that the chance of any one individual
entering the fossil record
is vanishingly small.
But the Earth is very, very old.
And over vast tracts of time,
the improbable becomes the probable.
That's the magic of the geological record.
Thus, multitudinous creatures
living and dying on an old planet
leave behind immense numbers of fossils,
each one a small miracle,
but collectively, inevitable.
 
Sixty-six million years ago,
an asteroid hits the Earth
and wipes out the dinosaurs.
This easily might not have been.
But we only get one history,
and it's the one that we have.
But this particular reality
was not inevitable.
The tiniest perturbation
of that asteroid far from Earth
would have caused it to miss
our planet by a wide margin.
The pivotal, calamitous day during which
the dinosaurs were wiped out,
setting the stage
for the modern world as we know it
didn't have to be.
It could've just been another day --
a Thursday, perhaps --
among the 63 billion days
already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.
But over geological time,
improbable, nearly impossible events
do occur.
Along the path from our wormy,
Cambrian ancestors
to primates dressed in suits,
innumerable forks in the road
led us to this very particular reality.
The bones of Dreadnoughtus
lay underground for 77 million years.
Who could have imagined
that a single species of shrew-like mammal
living in the cracks of the dinosaur world
would evolve into sentient beings
capable of characterizing
and understanding
the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?
 
I once stood at the head
of the Missouri River
and bestraddled it.
There, it's nothing more
than a gurgle of water
that issues forth from beneath a rock
in a boulder in a pasture,
high in the Bitterroot Mountains.
The stream next to it
runs a few hundred yards
and ends in a small pond.
Those two streams -- they look identical.
But one is an anonymous trickle of water,
and the other is the Missouri River.
Now go down to the mouth
of the Missouri, near St. Louis,
and it's pretty obvious
that that river is a big deal.
But go up into the Bitterroots
and look at the Missouri,
and human prospection does not
allow us to see it as anything special.
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period
and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.
You would never guess
that they would amount
to anything special,
and they probably wouldn't have,
were it not for that pesky asteroid.
 
Now, make a thousand more worlds
and a thousand more solar systems
and let them run.
You will never get the same result.
No doubt, those worlds would be
both amazing and amazingly improbable,
but they would not be our world
and they would not have our history.
There are an infinite number of histories
that we could've had.
We only get one, and wow,
did we ever get a good one.
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle
and pill bugs the length of a car
really existed.
 
Why study the ancient past?
Because it gives us perspective
and humility.
The dinosaurs died in the world's
fifth mass extinction,
snuffed out in a cosmic accident
through no fault of their own.
They didn't see it coming,
and they didn't have a choice.
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.
And the nature of the fossil record
tells us that our place on this planet
is both precarious
and potentially fleeting.
Right now, our species is propagating
an environmental disaster
of geological proportions
that is so broad and so severe,
it can rightly be called
the sixth extinction.
Only unlike the dinosaurs,
we can see it coming.
And unlike the dinosaurs,
we can do something about it.
That choice is ours.
 
Thank you.

These dragons from deep time
are incredible creatures.
They're bizzarre,
they're beautiful,
and there's very little
we know about them.
 
These thoughts were going
through my head
when I looked at the pages of
my first dinosaur book.
I was about five years old at the time,
and I decided there and then
that I would become a paleontologist.
Paleontology allowed me 
to combine my love for animals
with my desire to travel to 
far-flung corners of the world.
 
And now, a few years later,
I've led several expeditions
to the ultimate far-flung corner 
on this planet, the Sahara.
I've worked in the Sahara because
I've been on a quest
to uncover new remains of
a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur
called Spinosaurus.
 
A few bones of this animal
have been found
in the deserts of Egypt
and were described about 100 years ago
by a German paleontologist.
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones
were destroyed in World War II.
So all we're left with are just
a few drawings and notes.
 
From these drawings,
we know that this creature, which lived 
about 100 million years ago,
was very big,
it had tall spines on its back,
forming a magnificent sail,
and it had long, slender jaws, 
a bit like a crocodile,
with conical teeth,
that may have been used 
to catch slippery prey, like fish.
But that was pretty much 
all we knew
about this animal for the next 100 years.
 
My fieldwork took me to the border region
between Morocco and Algeria,
a place called the Kem Kem.
It's a difficult place to work in.
You have to deal with sandstorms
and snakes and scorpions,
and it's very difficult to find
good fossils there.
But our hard work paid off.
We discovered many incredible specimens.
There's the largest dinosaur bone
that had ever been found
in this part of the Sahara.
We found remains of giant
predatory dinosaurs,
medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,
and seven or eight different kinds
of crocodile-like hunters.
 
These fossils were deposited
in a river system.
The river system was also home 
to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,
a monster sawfish,
and the skies over the river system
were filled with pterosaurs,
flying reptiles.
It was a pretty dangerous place,
not the kind of place where you'd want
to travel to if you had a time machine.
 
So we're finding all these 
incredible fossils of animals
that lived alongside Spinosaurus,
but Spinosaurus itself proved
to be very elusive.
We were just finding bits and pieces
and I was hoping that we'd find
a partial skeleton at some point.
 
Finally, very recently,
we were able to track down a dig site
where a local fossil hunter found
several bones of Spinosaurus.
We returned to the site,
we collected more bones.
And so after 100 years we finally
had another partial skeleton
of this bizarre creature.
And we were able to reconstruct it.
 
We now know that 
Spinosaurus had a head
a little bit like a crocodile,
very different from other 
predatory dinosaurs,
very different from the T. rex.
But the really interesting information
came from the rest of the skeleton.
We had long spines,
the spines forming the big sail.
We had leg bones, we had skull bones,
we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --
again, very unusual, no other
dinosaur has feet like this --
and we think they may have been
used to walk on soft sediment,
or maybe for paddling in the water.
We also looked at the fine
microstructure of the bone,
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,
and it turns out that they're
very dense and compact.
Again, this is something we see in animals
that spend a lot of time in the water,
it's useful for buoyancy 
control in the water.
 
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones
and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.
And when we looked 
at the digital skeleton,
we realized that yes, this was
a dinosaur unlike any other.
It's bigger than a T. rex,
and yes, the head has "fish-eating"
written all over it,
but really the entire skeleton has
"water-loving" written all over it --
dense bone, paddle-like feet,
and the hind limbs are reduced in size,
and again, this is something
we see in animals
that spend a substantial amount 
of time in the water.
 
So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --
I'm looking at muscle attachments
and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --
we realize that we're dealing
with a river monster,
a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,
the ruler of this ancient river of giants,
feeding on the many aquatic animals
I showed you earlier on.
 
So that's really what makes this
an incredible discovery.
It's a dinosaur like no other.
And some people told me, "Wow,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.
There are not many things left
to discover in the world."
Well, I think nothing could be 
further from the truth.
I think the Sahara's 
still full of treasures,
and when people tell me there are
no places left to explore,
I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter,
Roy Chapman Andrews,
and he said, "Always, there has been
an adventure just around the corner --
and the world is still full of corners."
That was true many decades ago
when Roy Chapman Andrews
wrote these lines.
And it is still true today.
 
Thank you.

Shall I ask for a show
of hands or a clapping
of people in different generations?
I'm interested in how many
are three to 12 years old.
 
()
 
None, huh?
 
()
All right.
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.
Do you remember dinosaurs
when you were that age?
 
()
 
Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.
 
()
 
We're going to kind of go
in a different direction right now.
I hope you all realize that.
So I'll just give you my message up front:
Try not to go extinct.
 
()
 
That's it.
 
()
 
People ask me a lot --
in fact, one of the most asked
questions I get
is, why do children
like dinosaurs so much?
What's the fascination?
And I usually just say,
"Well, dinosaurs were big,
different and gone."
They're all gone.
Well that's not true,
but we'll get to the goose in a minute.
So that's sort of the theme:
big, different and gone.
The title of my talk:
Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:
The cause of a premature extinction.
 
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.
And there's lots of different shapes.
Lots of different kinds.
A long time ago,
back in the early 1900s,
museums were out looking for dinosaurs.
They went out and gathered them up.
And this is an interesting story.
Every museum wanted a little bigger
or better one than anybody else had.
So if the museum in Toronto went out
and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,
then the museum in Ottawa
wanted a bigger one, and a better one.
And that happened for all museums.
So everyone was out looking
for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.
And this was in the early 1900s.
 
By about 1970,
some scientists were sitting around
and they thought, "What in the world --
Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big.
Where are all the little ones?"
 
()
 
And they thought about it
and they even wrote papers about it:
"Where are the little dinosaurs?"
 
()
 
Well, go to a museum, you'll see,
see how many baby dinosaurs there are.
People assumed --
and this was actually a problem --
people assumed
that if they had little dinosaurs,
if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
they'd be easy to identify.
You'd have a big dinosaur
and a littler dinosaur.
 
()
 
But all they had were big dinosaurs.
 
And it comes down to a couple of things.
First off, scientists have egos,
and scientists like to name dinosaurs.
They like to name anything.
Everybody likes to have
their own animal that they named.
 
()
 
And so every time they found something
that looked a little different,
they named it something different.
And what happened, of course,
is we ended up with a whole
bunch of different dinosaurs.
 
In 1975,
a light went on in somebody's head.
Dr. Peter Dodson
at the University of Pennsylvania
actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do,
which is different
than the way reptiles grow.
And in fact,
he used the cassowary as an example.
And it's kind of cool --
if you look at the cassowary,
or any of the birds
that have crests on their heads,
they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow.
Now think about that.
They're basically retaining
their juvenile characteristics
very late in what we call ontogeny.
So allometric cranial ontogeny
is relative skull growth.
So you can see that if you actually found
one that was 80 percent grown
and you didn't know that it was going
to grow up to a cassowary,
you would think
they were two different animals.
 
So this was a problem,
and Peter Dodson pointed this out
using some duck-billed dinosaurs
then called Hypacrosaurus.
And he showed that if you were to take
a baby and an adult
and make an average
of what it should look like,
if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,
it would have a crest
about half the size of the adult.
But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all.
So this was interesting.
So this is where people went astray again.
I mean, if they'd have just taken that,
taken Peter Dodson's work,
and gone on with that,
then we would have a lot less
dinosaurs than we have.
But scientists have egos;
they like to name things.
And so they went on naming dinosaurs
because they were different.
 
Now we have a way of actually testing
to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
is a young one or an older one.
And that's by actually
cutting into their bones.
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
is hard to do, as you can imagine,
because in museums, bones are precious.
You go into a museum,
and they take really good care of them.
They put them in foam, little containers.
They're very well taken care of.
They don't like it if you come in
and want to saw them open and look inside.
 
()
 
So they don't normally let you do that.
 
()
 
But I have a museum
and I collect dinosaurs
and I can saw mine open.
So that's what I do.
 
()
 
So if you cut open a little dinosaur,
it's very spongy inside, like A.
And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
it's very massive.
You can tell it's mature bone.
So it's real easy to tell them apart.
So what I want to do is show you these.
In North America in the northern plains
of the United States
and the southern plains
of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
there's this unit of rock
called the Hell Creek Formation
that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth.
And there are 12 of them
that everyone recognizes --
I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
that went extinct.
And so we will evaluate them.
And that's sort of what I've been doing.
So my students, my staff,
we've been cutting them open.
Now as you can imagine,
cutting open a leg bone is one thing,
but when you go to a museum
and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?"
they say, "Go away."
 
()
 
So here are 12 dinosaurs.
And we want to look at these three first.
 
So these are dinosaurs
that are called Pachycephalosaurus.
And everybody knows
that these three animals are related.
And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever.
But no one ever considered
that they might be more closely related.
In other words,
people looked at them
and they saw the differences.
And you all know
that if you are going to determine
whether you're related
to your brother or your sister,
you can't do it by looking at differences.
You can only determine relatedness
by looking for similarities.
 
So people were looking at these
and they were talking
about how different they are.
Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
thick dome on its head,
and it's got some little bumps
on the back of its head,
and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
on the end of its nose.
And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
from the same age, lived at the same time,
has spikes sticking out
the back of its head.
It's got a little, tiny dome,
and it's got a bunch
of gnarly stuff on its nose.
And then there's this thing
called Dracorex hogwartsia.
Guess where that came from?
Dragon.
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes
sticking out of its head,
no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.
 
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff
sort of looked alike.
But they did look at these three
and they said, "These
are three different dinosaurs,
and Dracorex is probably
the most primitive of them.
And the other one
is more primitive than the other."
It's unclear to me how they actually
sorted these three of them out.
But if you line them up,
if you just take those three skulls
and just line them up,
they line up like this.
Dracorex is the littlest one,
Stygimoloch is the middle-size one,
Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.
And one would think,
that should give me a clue.
 
()
 
But it didn't give them a clue.
 
()
 
Because, well we know why.
Scientists like to name things.
 
So if we cut open Dracorex --
I cut open our Dracorex --
and look, it was spongy inside,
really spongy inside.
I mean, it is a juvenile
and it's growing really fast.
So it is going to get bigger.
If you cut open Stygimoloch,
it is doing the same thing.
The dome, that little dome,
is growing really fast.
It's inflating very fast.
What's interesting is the spike
on the back of the Dracorex
was growing very fast as well.
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing,
which means they're getting smaller
as that dome is getting bigger.
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,
Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome
and its little bumps on the back
of its head were also resorbing.
 
So just with these three dinosaurs,
as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize
that it is just a growth series
of the same animal.
Which of course means
that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.
 
()
 
OK.
 
()
 
Which of course means
we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.
 
So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --
he and I were looking at Triceratops.
And before the year 2000 --
now remember, Triceratops was first
found in the 1800s --
before 2000, no one had ever seen
a juvenile Triceratops.
There's a Triceratops
in every museum in the world,
but no one had ever collected a juvenile.
And we know why, right?
Because everybody wants to have a big one.
So everyone had a big one.
So we went out and collected
a whole bunch of stuff
and we found a whole bunch of little ones.
They're everywhere,
they're all over the place.
So we have a whole bunch
of them at our museum.
 
()
 
And everybody says
it's because I have a little museum.
When you have a little museum,
you have little dinosaurs.
 
()
 
If you look at the Triceratops,
you can see it's changing,
it's shape-shifting.
As the juveniles are growing up,
their horns actually curve backwards.
And then as they get older,
the horns grow forward.
And that's pretty cool.
If you look along the edge of the frill,
they have these little triangular bones
that actually grow big as triangles
and then they flatten against the frill
pretty much like the spikes do
on the Pachycephalosaurs.
And then, because the juveniles
are in my collection,
I cut them open ...
 
()
 
and look inside.
And the little one is really spongy.
And the middle-size one is really spongy.
But what was interesting
was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.
And this is a skull
that is two meters long.
It's a big skull.
 
But there's another dinosaur
that is found in this formation
that looks like a Triceratops,
except it's bigger,
and it's called Torosaurus.
And Torosaurus, when we cut
into it, has mature bone.
But it's got these big
holes in its shield.
And everybody says,
"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus
can't possibly be the same animal
because one of them's bigger
than the other one."
 
()
 
"And it has holes in its frill."
And I said, "Well do we have
any juvenile Torosauruses?"
And they said, "Well, no,
but it has holes in its frill."
 
So one of my graduate
students, John Scannella,
looked through our whole collection
and he actually discovered that the hole
starting to form in Triceratops
and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --
so he found the transitional ones
between Triceratops and Torosaurus,
which was pretty cool.
So now we know that Torosaurus
is actually a grown-up Triceratops.
Now when we name dinosaurs,
when we name anything,
the original name gets to stick
and the second name is thrown out.
So Torosaurus is extinct.
Triceratops, if you've heard the news,
a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.
They thought Torosaurus should be kept
and Triceratops thrown out,
but that's not going to happen.
 
()
 
All right, so we can do this
with a bunch of dinosaurs.
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus
and Anatotitan.
Anatotitan: giant duck.
It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.
Here's another one.
So we look at the bone histology.
The bone histology tells us
that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,
or at least a subadult,
and the other one is an adult,
and we have an ontogeny.
And we get rid of Anatotitan.
 
So we can just keep doing this.
And the last one is T. Rex.
So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.
 
()
 
Again, it makes you wonder.
 
()
 
But they had a good question.
They were looking at them and they said,
"One's got 17 teeth,
and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.
And that doesn't make any sense at all,
because we don't know of any dinosaurs
that gain teeth as they get older.
So it must be true --
they must be different."
So we cut into them.
And sure enough,
Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone
and the bigger one has more mature bone.
It looks like it could still get bigger.
And at the Museum
of the Rockies where we work,
I have four T. rexes,
so I can cut a whole bunch of them.
But I didn't have to cut
any of them really,
because I just lined up their jaws
and it turned out
the biggest one had 12 teeth
and the next smallest one had 13
and the next smallest had 14.
And of course, Nano has 17.
And we just went out and looked
at other people's collections
and we found one that has
sort of 15 teeth.
So again, real easy to say
that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny
included Nanotyrannus,
and therefore we can take out
another dinosaur.
 
()
 
So when it comes down
to our end Cretaceous,
we have seven left.
And that's a good number.
That's a good number
to go extinct, I think.
Now as you can imagine,
this is not very popular
with fourth-graders.
 
()
 
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,
they memorize them.
And they're not happy with this.
 
()
 
Thank you very much.
 
()
 
I want to talk to you about something
kind of big.
We'll start here.
65 million years ago
the dinosaurs had a bad day.
()
A chunk of rock six miles across,
moving something like 50 times
the speed of a rifle bullet,
slammed into the Earth.
It released its energy all at once,
and it was an explosion that was
mind-numbing.
If you took every nuclear weapon ever built
at the height of the Cold War,
lumped them together and blew them up
at the same time,
that would be one one-millionth
of the energy released at that moment.
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.
Okay?
 
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
We all live here in Boulder.
If you look out your window and you can see
Long's Peak, you're probably familiar with it.
Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out
in space.
Take Meeker, Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there,
and put that in space as well,
and Mt. Everest, and K2,
and the Indian peaks.
Then you're starting to get an idea of
how much rock we're talking about, okay?
We know it was that big because of
the impact it had and the crater it left.
It hit in what we now know as Yucatan,
the Gulf of Mexico.
You can see here, there's the
Yucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumel
off the east coast there.
 
Here is how big of a crater was left.
It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale,
okay, there you go. The scale here is
50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers
on the bottom. This thing was
300 kilometers across -- 200 miles --
an enormous crater that excavated out
vast amounts of earth that splashed around
the globe and set fires all over the planet,
threw up enough dust to block out the sun.
It wiped out 75 percent of all species
on Earth.
Now, not all asteroids are that big.
Some of them are smaller.
Here is one that came in
over the United States
in October of 1992.
It came in on a Friday night.
Why is that important?
Because back then, video cameras were
just starting to become popular, and people
would bring them, parents would bring them,
to their kids' football games to film their kids
play football. And since this came in on a Friday,
they were able to get this great footage
of this thing breaking up as it came in
over West Virgina, Maryland, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey until it did that
to a car in New York.
()
 
Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,
but then again you can see the rock
which is sitting right here,
about the size of a football, that hit
that car and did that damage.
Now this thing was probably about the size
of a school bus when it first came in.
It broke up through atmospheric pressure,
it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart
and did some damage.
Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot
or your head, because it would do that to it.
That would be bad.
But it won't wipe out, you know, all life
on Earth, so that's fine. But it turns out,
you don't need something six miles across
to do a lot of damage.
There is a median point between tiny rock
and gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of you
have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,
there is a crater in the desert there that is
so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater.
 
To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.
If you look up at the top, that's a parking lot,
and those are recreational vehicles right there.
So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.
The object that formed this was probably about
30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size
of Mackey Auditorium here.
It came in at speeds that were tremendous,
slammed into the ground, blew up,
and exploded with the energy of roughly
a 20-megaton nuclear bomb --
a very hefty bomb.
This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have
wiped out a few buffalo or antelope,
or something like that out in the desert,
but it probably would not have caused
global devastation.
 
It turns out that these things don't have to
hit the ground to do a lot of damage.
Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the
Tunguska region -- for those of you who are
Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters,"
when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift
since the Siberia blast of 1909, where he got
the date wrong, but that's okay. ()
It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that.
()
Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere
and this one blew up above the ground, several
miles up above the surface of the Earth.
The heat from the explosion set fire to the
forest below it, and then the shock wave
came down and knocked down trees for
hundreds of square miles, okay?
This did a huge amount of damage.
And again, this was a rock probably roughly
the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in.
 
In Meteor Crater it was made of metal,
and metal is much tougher, so it made it
to the ground.
The one over Tunguska was probably made
of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it
blew up in the air. Either way, these are
tremendous explosions, 20 megatons.
Now, when these things blow up, they're not
going to do global ecological damage.
They're not going to do something like
the dinosaur-killer did.
They're just not big enough.
But they will do global economic damage,
because they don't have to hit, necessarily,
to do this kind of damage.
They don't have to do global devastation.
If one of these things were to hit
pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic.
But if it came over a city, an important city --
not that any city is more important than others,
but some of them we depend on them more
on the global economic basis -- that could do
a huge amount of damage to us
as a civilization.
 
So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ...
()
what can we do about this? All right?
This is a potential threat.
Let me note that we have not had
a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer
for 65 million years. They're very rare.
The smaller ones happen more often, but
probably on the order of a millennium,
every few centuries or every few thousand
years, but it's still something to be aware of.
Well, what do we do about them?
The first thing we have to do is find them.
This is an image of an asteroid that passed
us in 2009.
It's right here.
But you can see that it's extremely faint.
I don't even know if you can see that
in the back row. These are just stars.
This is a rock that was about 30 yards across,
so roughly the size of the ones that blew up
over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.
 
These things are faint.
They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.
We have to find these things first.
Well the good news is, we're looking for them.
NASA has devoted money to this.
The National Science Foundation, other
countries are very interested in doing this.
We're building telescopes that are looking
for the threat. That's a great first step,
but what's the second step? The second step
is that we see one heading toward us,
we have to stop it. What do we do?
You've probably heard about the asteroid
Apophis. If you haven't yet, you will.
If you've heard about the Mayan 2012
apocalypse, you're going to hear about Apophis,
because you're keyed in to all the doomsday
networks anyway.
 
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.
It's roughly 250 yards across, so it's
pretty big -- big size, you know,
bigger than a football stadium -- and it's going to
pass by the Earth in April of 2029.
And it's going to pass us so close that it's
actually going to come underneath
our weather satellites.
The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit
of this thing so much that if it's just right,
if it passes through this region of space,
this kidney bean-shaped region called
the keyhole, the Earth's gravity will bend it
just enough that seven years later
on April 13, which is a Friday, I'll note,
in the year 2036 ... ()
-- you can't plan that kind of stuff --
Apophis is going to hit us. And it's
250 meters across, so it would do
unbelievable damage.
 
Now the good news is that the odds of it
actually passing through this keyhole and
hitting us next go-around are one in a million,
roughly -- very, very low odds, so I personally
am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.
I don't think Apophis is a problem.
In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise,
because it woke us up to the dangers
of these things.
This thing was discovered just a few years
ago and could hit us a few years from now.
It won't, but it gives us a chance to study
these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really
necessarily understand these keyholes, and
now we do and it turns out
that's really important, because how do you
stop an asteroid like this?
 
Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're
standing in the middle of the road and a car's
headed for you? What do you do? You do this.
Right? Move. The car goes past you.
But we can't move the Earth, at least
not easily, but we can move a small asteroid.
And it turns out, we've even done it.
In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe
called Deep Impact, which slammed into --
slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.
Comets are very much like asteroids.
The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way.
The purpose was to make a crater to excavate
the material and see what was underneath
the surface of this comet, which we learned
quite a bit about.
We did move the comet a little tiny bit,
not very much, but that wasn't the point.
However, think about this.
This thing is orbiting the sun at
10 miles per second, 20 miles per second.
We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay?
Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.
That means we can do it again.
 
If we need, if we see an asteroid that's coming
toward us, and it's headed right for us,
and we have two years to go, boom! We hit it.
You can try to -- you know, if you watch
the movies, you might think about,
why don't we use a nuclear weapon?
It's like, well, you can try that, but the problem is timing.
You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,
you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds
of tolerance or else you'll just miss it.
And there are a lot of other problems
with that. It's very hard to do.
But just hitting something? That's pretty easy.
I think even NASA can do that,
and they proved that they can. ()
The problem is, what happens if you hit
this asteroid, you've changed the orbit,
you measure the orbit and then you find out,
oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole,
and now it's going to hit us in three years.
 
Well, my opinion is, fine. Okay?
It's not hitting us in six months. That's good.
Now we have three years to do something else.
And you can hit it again. That's kind of
ham-fisted. You might just push it into a third
keyhole or whatever, so you don't do that.
And this is the part, it's the part I just love.
()
After the big macho "Rrrrrrr BAM! We're
gonna hit this thing in the face,"
then we bring in the velvet gloves.
()
There's a group of scientists and engineers
and astronauts and they call themselves
The B612 Foundation. For those of you
who've read "The Little Prince,"
you understand that reference, I hope. The little prince
who lived on an asteroid, it was called B612.
 
These are smart guys -- men and women --
astronauts, like I said, engineers.
Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9
astronaut, is on this. Dan Durda, my friend
who made this image, works here at
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder,
on Walnut Street. He created this image for this,
and he's actually one of the astronomers
who works for them. If we see an asteroid
that's going to hit the Earth and we have
enough time, we can hit it to move it into
a better orbit. But then what we do is we launch
a probe that has to weigh a ton or two.
It doesn't have to be huge -- couple of tons,
not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid.
You don't land on it, because these things are
tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them.
Instead you get near it.
 
The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe,
and the probe has a couple of tons of mass.
It has a little tiny bit of gravity, but it's enough
that it can pull the asteroid, and you have your
rockets set up, so you can -- oh, you can barely
see it here, but there's rocket plumes -- and you
basically, these guys are connected by their
own gravity, and if you move the probe very
slowly, very, very gently, you can very easily
finesse that rock into a safe orbit.
You can even put in orbit around the Earth
where we could mine it, although that's a
whole other thing. I won't go into that.
()
But we'd be rich!
()
 
So think about this, right?
There are these giant rocks flying out there,
and they're hitting us, and they're doing
damage to us, but we've figured out how to do
this, and all the pieces are in place to do this.
We have astronomers in place with telescopes
looking for them. We have smart people,
very, very smart people, who are concerned
about this and figuring out how to fix the
problem, and we have the technology to do this.
This probe actually can't use chemical rockets.
Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too
much push. The probe would just shoot away.
 
We invented something called an ion drive,
which is a very, very, very low-thrust engine.
It generates the force a piece of paper would
have on your hand, incredibly light,
but it can run for months and years,
providing that very gentle push.
If anybody here is a fan of the original "Star Trek,"
they ran across an alien ship that had
an ion drive, and Spock said,
"They're very technically sophisticated.
They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."
Yeah, we have an ion drive now. ()
We don't have the Enterprise, but
we've got an ion drive now.
()
Spock.
()
 
So ...
that's the difference, that's the difference
between us and the dinosaurs.
This happened to them.
It doesn't have to happen to us.
The difference between the dinosaurs and us
is that we have a space program
and we can vote,
and so we can change our future.
()
We have the ability to change our future.
65 million years from now,
we don't have to have our bones
collecting dust in a museum.
Thank you very much.
()
 
When I was growing up in Montana,
I had two dreams.
I wanted to be a paleontologist,
a dinosaur paleontologist,
and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.
And so that's what I've been striving for
all of my life.
I was very fortunate
early in my career.
I was fortunate
in finding things.
I wasn't very good at reading things.
In fact, I don't read much of anything.
I am extremely dyslexic,
and so reading is the hardest thing I do.
But instead, I go out and I find things.
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
()
And I wander about the hills,
and I have found a few things.
 
And I have been fortunate enough
to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere
and the first baby dinosaurs in nests,
the first dinosaur embryos
and massive accumulations of bones.
And it happened to be at a time
when people were just starting to begin to realize
that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles
that people had thought for so many years.
People were starting to get an idea
that dinosaurs were special.
 
And so, at that time,
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses
along with my colleagues.
We were able to actually say
that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had --
that dinosaurs built nests
and lived in colonies
and cared for their young,
brought food to their babies
and traveled in gigantic herds.
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things
and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence
that dinosaurs changed
from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different --
which it is in all social animals.
In social groups of animals,
the juveniles always look different than the adults.
The adults can recognize the juveniles;
the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture
of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
 
()
 
But it is that social thing
that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.
And then Steven Spielberg, of course,
depicts these dinosaurs
as being very social creatures.
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,
and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people
to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
You all know the story, right.
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
 
If you want to make a dinosaur,
you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap --
otherwise known as amber --
that has some blood-sucking insects in it,
good ones,
and you get your insect and you drill into it
and you suck out some DNA,
because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days
sucked dinosaur DNA out.
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory
and you clone it.
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,
or something like that,
and then you wait,
and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.
And everybody's happy about that.
()
And they're happy over and over again.
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
And then, then, then, and then ...
Then the dinosaurs, being social,
act out their socialness,
and they get together,
and they conspire.
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie --
conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.
 
So I assume everybody knows
that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,
and you drilled into it,
and you got something out of that insect,
and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,
you'd have a room full of mosquitos.
()
()
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
 
Now if you want dinosaur DNA,
I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
Back in 1993 when the movie came out,
we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation
to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,
and we chose the dinosaur on the left,
a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.
And one of my former doctoral students,
Dr. Mary Schweitzer,
actually had the background
to do this sort of thing.
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,
one of the thigh bones,
and she actually found
some very interesting structures in there.
They found these red circular-looking objects,
and they looked, for all the world,
like red blood cells.
And they're in
what appear to be the blood channels
that go through the bone.
And so she thought, well, what the heck.
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
But she did find heme,
which is the biological foundation
of hemoglobin.
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried
and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
 
So a few years went by,
and then we started the Hell Creek Project.
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking
to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,
and hopefully find some dinosaurs
that had more material in them.
And out in eastern Montana
there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,
and not very many people,
and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,
but we found one special Tyrannosaur,
and we called it B-rex.
And B-rex was found
under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
It wasn't a very complete T. rex,
and it wasn't a very big T. rex,
but it was a very special B-rex.
And I and my colleagues cut into it,
and we were able to determine,
by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,
that B-rex had died at the age of 16.
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,
because we haven't found the oldest one yet.
But this one died at the age of 16.
 
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,
and she was actually able to determine
that B-rex was a female
based on medullary tissue
found on the inside of the bone.
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,
the calcium storage basically,
when an animal is pregnant,
when a bird is pregnant.
So here was the character
that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
Now we all know that bones are fossilized,
and so if you dump it into acid,
there shouldn't be anything left.
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
But she also found osteocytes,
which are the cells that laid down the bones.
And try and try, we could not find DNA,
but she did find evidence of proteins.
 
But we thought maybe --
well, we thought maybe
that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
And so we built a laboratory
in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,
and actually took the laboratory to the field
where we could get better samples.
And we did. We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
So we have discovered
that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,
just breaks down too fast.
We're just not going to be able
to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur
based on a dinosaur.
 
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them
as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs
and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs
are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur
because we already have them.
 
()
 
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.
()
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
()
"You can call it a dinosaur,
but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."
()
"The chicken is not."
()
So this is our problem,
as you can imagine.
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it
because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
()
()
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"Fix the chicken."
()
So that's what I'm here to tell you about:
how we are going to fix a chicken.
 
So we have a number of ways
that we actually can fix the chicken.
Because evolution works,
we actually have some evolutionary tools.
We'll call them biological modification tools.
We have selection.
And we know selection works.
We started out with a wolf-like creature
and we ended up with a Maltese.
I mean, that's --
that's definitely genetic modification.
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
You take a glow gene
out of a coral or a jellyfish
and you stick it in a zebrafish,
and, puff, they glow.
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits
and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
()
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
 
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation
is basically --
an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
You heard
that occasionally children are born with tails,
and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.
And so there are a number of atavisms
that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison
actually figured out a way to stimulate
the gene for teeth,
and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on
and produce teeth in chickens.
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
 
()
 
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,
Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,
is actually looking at atavisms.
And he's looking at them
by looking at the embryo genesis of birds
and actually looking at how they develop,
and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.
He's also interested in the transformation
of the arm, the hand, to the wing.
He's looking for those genes as well.
And I said, "Well, if you can find those,
I can just reverse them
and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
 
If you look at dinosaur hands,
a velociraptor
has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,
still has that very primitive hand.
But as you can see, the pigeon,
or a chicken or anything else, another bird,
has kind of a weird-looking hand,
because the hand is a wing.
But the cool thing is
that, if you look in the embryo,
as the embryo is developing
the hand actually looks
pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
It has the three fingers, the three digits.
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
We want to stop that gene from turning on,
fusing those hands together,
so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,
like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically
rudimentary tails.
And so we know
that in embryo,
as the animal is developing,
it actually has a relatively long tail.
But a gene turns on
and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
 
So what we're trying to do really
is take our chicken,
modify it
and make the chickenosaurus.
()
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
And people always say, "Why do that?
Why make this thing?
What good is it?"
Well, that's a good question.
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids
about evolutionary biology
and developmental biology
and all sorts of things.
And quite frankly, I think
if Colonel Sanders
was to be careful how he worded it,
he could actually advertise an extra piece.
()
 
Anyway --
When our dino-chicken hatches,
it will be, obviously, the poster child,
or what you might call a poster chick,
for technology, entertainment and design.
 
Thank you.

So, I want to start out with
this beautiful picture from my childhood.
I love the science fiction movies.
Here it is: "This Island Earth."
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.
Two-and-a-half years in the making.
()
I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,
but Hollywood goes to the chase.
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:
flying saucers and aliens.
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,
and they move about with great speed. Aliens.
 
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point
where we got tired of turning on the TV
and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,
and tried to write a counter-argument to it,
and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,
for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place
where you could probably get not just life, but complexity,
which requires a huge amount of evolution,
and therefore constancy of conditions.
So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,
let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?
If you go back two billion years,
you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.
 
Well, "Rare Earth" actually
taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.
Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,
and with all great earnestness walked in.
David Brin was going to debate me on this,
and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.
I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."
You cannot take people's aliens away from them
and expect to be anybody's friends.
Well, the second part of that, soon after --
and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,
and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,
and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."
It was, "It burns! It burns!"
Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.
SETI wants there to be stuff out there.
I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.
And I really do think we have to start thinking
about what's a good planet and what isn't.
 
Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,
even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?
Because this was a slide that was passed
between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC --
and it can't even get the letters right --
()
-- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,
and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
I mean, there we are.
 
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.
Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there
and to live on its surface if we're protected.
But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history
it may very well have harbored Earth-like life,
it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse --
that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface --
because of rampant carbon dioxide.
 
Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict
what's going to happen to our particular planet.
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo
of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth --
following the first horrible microbial age.
In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,
complexity arose,
and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet
as they have been here now,
till we hit the second microbial age.
And that will happen, paradoxically --
everything you hear about global warming --
when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,
we are no longer going to have to have plants
that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.
So, after that we probably have seven billion years.
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,
and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,
the Earth is consumed by a large Sun,
and this is what's left.
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,
and we are in its golden summer age right now.
 
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age,
but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.
And that's the fate of a planet, too.
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,
or gets blasted by some supernova nearby
in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.
But what about accidental death?
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years
have been charting death. It's strange --
extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about
until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.
He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,
and he said, Aha! It's extinct.
And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding
a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been
since complex life really began to leave
a very interesting fossil record.
In that complex record of fossils,
there were times when lots of stuff
seemed to be dying out very quickly,
and the father/mother geologists
called these "mass extinctions."
 
All along it was thought to be either an act of God
or perhaps long, slow climate change,
and that really changed in 1980,
in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,
where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out
what was the time difference between these white rocks,
which held creatures of the Cretaceous period,
and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.
How long did it take to go from one system to the next?
And what they found was something unexpected.
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,
and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here --
is filled with iridium.
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,
and it's filled with quartz grains
that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.
 
Now, in this slide the white is chalk,
and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.
The chalk itself's composed by plankton
which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,
so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,
and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,
and then you have black rock.
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom
in the absence of plankton.
And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,
because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,
and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,
the death of these beautiful ammonites,
Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,
and so much else.
 
I mean, it must be true,
because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,
and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,
totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.
Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:
the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,
there are present-day processes that will explain it.
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,
so this is a type of neo-catastrophism,
and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment
to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;
and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.
 
Well, there are five major mass extinctions
over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.
They range from 450 million years ago
to the last, the K-T, number four,
but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,
sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed
on large-body impact.
But is this true?
 
The most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact
because of this beautiful structure on the right.
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes
of my late beloved '60s,
they're called "buckyballs."
This evidence was used to suggest
that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,
and it captures bits of the comet.
Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.
 
But is this true?
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,
I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year
in the great Karoo desert.
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa
into the new South Africa as I went year by year.
And I worked on this Permian extinction,
camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.
And the fossils are extraordinary.
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.
These are mammal-like reptiles.
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.
That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal
that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,
probably had a head like a lion.
This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.
But there's lots of stuff.
This is my poor son, Patrick.
()
This is called paleontological child abuse.
Hold still, you're the scale.
()
 
There was big stuff back then.
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.
The age of mammals had well and truly started
250 million years ago ...
... and then a catastrophe happened.
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.
It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.
Now, luckily,
this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:
this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture --
there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny --
this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.
If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.
Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;
there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.
 
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.
But we've got survivors and things that get through,
and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.
The survivors that do get through
produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,
swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.
And there they would hide for 160 million years,
until liberated by that K-T asteroid.
 
So, if not impact, what?
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,
to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,
and the microbes are still out there.
They hate we animals.
They really want their world back.
And they've tried over and over and over again.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions
because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself --
anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles
believing in the Gaia theory? No.
 
So, I really suspect there's an alternative,
and that life does actually try to do itself in --
not consciously, but just because it does.
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.
There are microbes which, through their metabolism,
produce hydrogen sulfide,
and they do so in large amounts.
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes --
and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes
which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,
and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them --
but we can also detect their presence in the past.
 
And the last three years have seen
an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.
I am almost extinct --
I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.
But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students --
collect biomarkers.
They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it,
and from that they can produce compounds
which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment
and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,
and be extracted and tell us who was there.
 
And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,
at many of these mass extinction boundaries,
this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,
and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide --
enough, for instance, to come out of solution.
This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,
to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:
many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,
by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:
hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.
 
Well, what's the source of this?
In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.
This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;
actually, the effects are even worse.
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,
spreads out over the surface of the planet.
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything,
it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.
 
So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together,
and what we try to do now is
track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record --
and we can do this from a variety of means --
and put all the red lines here,
when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.
And there's two things that are really evident here to me,
is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.
But the second thing that's not shown on here:
the Earth has never had any ice on it
when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.
We are at 380 and climbing.
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,
but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.
So, there goes the ice caps,
and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.
I live in a view house now;
I'm going to have waterfront.
 
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long
to take place on planet Earth.
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.
They stop complex life from existing.
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago --
and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.
It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.
This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,
if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,
this is off the Great Barrier Reef.
And as we speak now,
these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.
 
But the thing about this is that every once in a while
we divers can run into trouble,
so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.
We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.
So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.
I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?
Well now, I die.
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:
I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:
80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower
and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals
have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,
and our bodies have adapted.
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.
 
This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.
He bleeds out pigs.
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide --
the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions --
and he turns a mammal into a reptile.
"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles
having undergone a series of exposures to H2S."
I got this email from him two years ago;
he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."
So, he now has taken mice down
for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,
and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through --
the dotted line, the temperatures.
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,
and down it goes, down it goes.
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide
in this solid graph,
and look what happens to its temperature.
Its temperature drops.
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,
and comes out of this perfectly fine.
 
Here is a way we can get people to critical care.
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.
Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.
You're in an accident. You've got two choices:
you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide
and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.
What are you going to do?
Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?
This is coming towards us,
and I think this is going to be a revolution.
We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.
 
The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,
and, yes, we have to think about the long term,
because we will get hit again.
But there's a far worse danger confronting us.
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.
Give us a few millennia --
and we humans should last those few millennia --
will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.
How many of us flew here?
How many of us have gone through
our entire Kyoto quota
just for flying this year?
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.
We have to beat this.
I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.

Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.
Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here
is that we have in our own bodies
a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide
that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions
due to climate change?
 
Peter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us
can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.
This is what Roth has found out.
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect
how many of these have happened in the past.
 
CA: It's simultaneously
an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ...
 
PW: Blessing and curse.
 
Sixty-five million years ago, a very important
and catastrophic event
changed the course of life on land.
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about
are just the scum of the Earth on the land --
the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us
because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.
And these animals disappeared,
and a separate life, mammals,
radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this
in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core
from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,
and the things that we've experienced
in the entire record of humankind history
can't really quite get around the kind of disaster
that this represented for the Earth.
 
So even before that impact was known,
even before scientists in general came to an agreement
over the theory of evolution,
scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes
actually had divided Earth's life's history
into these two episodes:
Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.
And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely
with geologic history.
So we have a Mesozoic period,
an age of fragmentation,
and a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection --
South America to North America, India to Asia.
And so my work, really, is trying to understand
the character of that Mesozoic radiation
compared to the Cenozoic radiation
to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals
about what life on drifting continents
really can tell us about evolution.
 
The work immediately begs the question,
"Why didn't they go into the waters?"
I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.
You can go outside -- see many other examples.
Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact
we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that?
Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size,
and why didn't they burrow?
Why didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things,
what kinds of animals were in those spaces?
And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us
about, you know, how evolution works on land?
Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.
In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size --
the size you are when you inherit
a vacant ecospace
from whatever natural disaster.
 
Looking at dinosaur evolution
and studying it, digging it up for many years,
I end up looking at the mammal radiation,
and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,
advancing by an order of magnitude.
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,
an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
You want to measure it by diversity?
You want to measure it by
the time it took to reach maximum body size?
Yes, they do have larger body size,
but many of them are smaller,
but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals
to achieve maximum body size
and invade all those habitats.
 
So there's lessons to learn,
and there's lessons to learn from the exception,
the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made,
and many other scholars have made around the world.
This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.
We now know this transition is the one time
that dinosaurs actually went below
that body size --
we're going to see where they began in a minute --
and it is the one time that they rapidly
invaded all the habitats
I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in.
They became marine. We now know them today
from the ice caps.
There's burrowing birds.
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes,
and, of course, they inhabit the land.
 
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series
that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.
We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,
and if you go to different layers, you find things
that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,
so that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs --
or, more appropriately, feathers -- as to decide whether it's actually
a non-avian or an avian.
It is the greatest transition that we have, actually,
on land from one habitat to another,
bar none,
to understand how a bony,
fairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal
could make such a transition.
It is really our greatest -- one of our greatest -- evolutionary sequences.
 
Now, my work began at the beginning.
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution,
I'd have to go back to those beds
where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place
where the earliest dinosaurs existed.
I'd like to call for this little video clip
to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:
"Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"
If we could roll that first video clip.
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride
through those early beds,
and they're located in Northeastern Argentina.
And we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,
dinosaurs had basically taken over.
At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth.
That's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.
 
You go into an area like this, you get a geologic map,
you get a topographic map,
and the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area.
And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils.
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that
to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs
and find, really, everything that existed --
not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky,
and you dig a place like that,
you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.
228 million years old, we found
what really is the most primitive dinosaur:
that's the Ur-dinosaur.
A three-and-a-half foot thing,
beautiful skull, predator,
meat-eater, a two-legged animal.
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know,
or your kids know, at least, on four legs.
This is sort of a look at the skull,
and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
It looks rather bird-like because it is.
It's bird-like and hollow.
A predator. Maybe 25 pounds,
or 10 kilograms.
That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began.
That is 10 times larger
than the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.
We are extremely dinosaur-like,
and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.
 
Now, if you want to understand what happened
then when the continents broke apart,
and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers, as they are --
found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,
because it was those continents that are least explored.
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally,
you really have to force yourself to go down
to the four corners of the Earth --
Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia --
and start putting together some of these pieces.
I've been to some of those continents, but Africa was,
in the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely.
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle,
with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock
if you could survive an expedition.
 
There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place.
To be able to excavate
the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara
and take them out, you really have to put together
an expedition team that can handle the conditions.
Some of them are political. Many of them are physical.
Some of them -- the most important -- are mental.
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions --
you have to drive into the desert,
you will see landscapes in many cases --
you can see from what we've discovered --
that nobody else has ever seen.
And the kinds of teams they bring in?
Well, they're
composed of
people who understand science as adventure with a purpose.
They're usually students who've never seen a desert.
Some of them are more experienced.
 
Your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport --
your job as a leader is to try to inspire them
to do more work than they've ever done in their life
under conditions that they can't imagine.
So, 125 degrees is normal.
The ground surface at 150 -- typical.
So, you can't leave your normal metal tools out
because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.
So, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu.
You're really rubbing shoulders
with the world's last great nomadic people.
These are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives
much as they have for centuries.
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground,
and make them enter the pages of history.
To do that, you've got to actually transport them
thousands of miles out of the desert.
 
We're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger --
or Niger, in our English language -- north of Nigeria --
that's where this photograph was taken.
Basically you're talking about a country that,
when we started working there, did not have container traffic.
You transported the bones out yourself
to the coast of Africa,
onto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.
That's a 2,000 mile journey.
So enormous excavations and a lot of work,
and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs
that you saw buried there -- 20 tons of material --
we erect Jobaria,
a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents.
It really is a little bit out of place temporally.
It looks nothing like what we would find
if we dug in contemporary beds in North America.
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble.
 
And, you know, on and on --
a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this --
and some of you have had the chance to touch it --
this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old.
This is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered.
It is an incredible view of life,
and it really began when we began to understand
the depth of time.
It's only been with us for less than a century,
and in that time, that fourth dimension,
when radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago,
and we could actually tell how old some of these things were,
is probably the most profound transformation,
because it changes the way we look at ourselves
and the world dramatically.
When you pick up a piece of history like that,
I think it can transform
kids that are possibly interested in science.
 
That's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus.
Here's some others.
This is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.
It turns out to have a forebrain
one-fifteenth the size of a human.
This was the cover of Science, because they thought
that humans were more intelligent than these animals,
but we can see by some in our administration
that despite
the enormous advantage in brain volume
some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway,
smaller raptors.
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of --
all those small animals --
they all come from northern continents.
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent,
and guess what? You start preparing it.
It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.
It's really a wholly separate radiation.
So what we're trying to piece together here is a story.
It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur
that we reconstructed from Africa.
 
Crocodiles, of course,
and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet.
And huge things -- I mean, this is a
lower jaw just laying there in the desert
of this enormous crocodile.
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws.
We had to try and reconstruct this.
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles
to understand how crocodiles scale.
Could I have the second little video clip?
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure.
We had to find and measure
the largest crocodiles living today.
 
Narrator: ... as long as their boat.
 
Man: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.
 
Narrator: If they can just land it,
this croc will provide useful data,
helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.
 
Man: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.
 
Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.
 
Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.
 
Man: I got the back legs.
 
Man 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.
I've got it. I've got the back legs.
Somebody get the front legs.
 
Paul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.
Wow.
Sixty-five. Wow.
That's a big skull.
 
Narrator: Big, but less than half the size
of supercroc's skull.
 
Man: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.
 
Man: I knew it was big.
 
PS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.
 
Narrator: Paul has his data, so they decide
to release the animal back into the river.
 
PS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!
 
Narrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.
 
PS: Okay, when I say three, we move.
One, two, three!
Whoa!
 
So -- there were --
()
Well, you know, the -- the fossil record is truly amazing
because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.
We proved with those measurements
that crocodiles scaled isometrically.
It depended on the shape of their skull, though,
so we had to actually get those measurements
to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world
that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male.
Anyway, you find other things, too.
I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara
to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site.
We found this last year.
Two hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.
 
This is a ceremonial disk.
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara
5,000 years ago is been sitting out there
waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet.
Now, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.
It's really an island continent.
It was a precursor to India,
a messenger from Gondwana --
a lost paradise of dinosaurs
isolated for millions of years.
No one's found them. We know where they are,
and we're going to go and get them next year.
They're only between 13 and 14,000 feet,
but if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K.
Now, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history
so that we can try to understand
some basic patterns of evolution.
I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy
that we've been compiling
to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.
We can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,
but we can learn some of the rules of the game,
and that's really what we're trying to do.
 
With regard to the biogeographic question,
the Earth is dividing.
These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices.
You get divided, and a continent's division
corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,
or you're crafty, and you manage to escape
from one to the other and erase that division,
or you're living peacefully on each side,
and on one side you just go extinct,
and you survive on the other side and create a difference.
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other
of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.
And you take those four instances
and you realize you have a complex problem.
And so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers
from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated --
we call it dispersal -- around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole,
to maintain similarity between continents.
But when they were divided, indeed they were divided,
and we do see the continents
carving differences among dinosaurs.
 
But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.
We have downgraded this factor.
It carves up the history of life,
and gives us the differences that we see
in the dinosaur world towards the end,
right before the bolide impact.
The best way to test this is to actually create a model.
So if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.
I want to give you three dimensions.
So you see the tree of life,
but now I've added the dimension of area.
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time.
Now we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.
 
This is a computer program
which has three knobs.
We can control those things that we're worried about:
extinction, sampling, dispersal --
going from one area to another.
And ultimately we can control the branching
to mimic what we think the continents were like,
and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,
to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not,
at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.
 
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here
talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago,
which is related to the fact that I never --
and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters,
there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer
honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand,
but there are a number of you out there that started your
scientific, technical, entertainment career
as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.
I was one of those. I was failed by my school -- my school failed me.
Who's pointing fingers?
Several teachers nearly killed me.
I found myself in art.
I was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.
And I went on -- that's my first painting on canvas.
I read a dictionary. I got into college.
I became an artist. O.K., and started drawing.
It became abstract.
I worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there.
Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio.
I took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.
 
But really it's the same discipline -- they're kindred disciplines.
I mean, is there anything
that is not visualizing what can't be seen,
in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it
that's out there, or seeing the distortion
that we try to see
as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another?
This is a very extraordinarily visual.
I give you a human face because you're experts at that.
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.
They're really kindred disciplines.
But what we're trying to create in Chicago
is a way to get,
collect together, those students
who are least represented in our science and technology spheres.
We all know, and there's been several allusions to it,
that we are failing in our ability to produce
enough scientists, engineers and technicians.
 
We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase,
and now, as you see the increase
in the pace of what we're doing,
it becomes even more prominent. 
Where are all these people going to come from?
And a more general question for our society is,
what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?
What about all the kids like me that were in school --
kids like some of you out there --
that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance
to participate in science and technology?
 
Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important.
Niger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately
to do something in Niger.
They have an AIDS problem. I asked --
the U.S. State Department asked the government recently,
What do you want to do? And they gave them two problems.
Dinosaurs was one of them.
Give us a museum of dinosaurs,
and we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry.
And I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED,
or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.
But when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities,
the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city I come from --
there's legions of kids out there
like these.
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries --
as to how we get these kids involved in science.
 
We've started in Chicago
an organization -- a non-profit organization --
called Project Exploration.
These are two kids from Project Exploration.
We met them in their early stages in high school. They were --
failing to poor students,
and they are now -- one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.
We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old.
And we created a track record.
Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,
track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.
So, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,
90 percent going to college, many first-generation,
90 percent of those choosing science as a career.
It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,
well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,
but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.
 
It's gone through science as an inquiry,
which was a big advance,
and Dewey back at Chicago --
you learn by doing.
To -- you learn by envisioning yourself
as a scientist,
and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.
The next step is to learn the capability
to make yourself a scientist.
You have to have those steps. If you have --
It's easy to get kids interested in science.
It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,
which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium
and presenting something as a knowledgeable person,
and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist
and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.
 
And so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago.
We have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing --
and I've talked to some people here at TED --
it's not going to look like anything you've seen before.
It's going to be part-school, part-museum hall,
part-conservatory, part-zoo,
and part of an answer to the problem
of how you interest kids in science.
Thank you very much.
 
I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.
And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.
And then I was an entertainer, I guess.
And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was --
I was out of the house at about 15 and a half,
and I never wound up going into college.
I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.
I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.
 
()
It's really cool.
 
Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,
at least from my small aperture of the world.
This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.
I'm in my garage, making weird stuff.
And then you go to these toy companies
and there's some guy across the table,
and he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass."
You know, you think it's so cool, but they --
anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.
This is the name of my company, Giving Toys.
So I used to work at Mattel, actually.
And after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,
and then got the license to make the maker.
So this is a hamburger maker that
you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes --
and this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.
I beat up the pasta maker to make that.
Then this is a McNugget maker, I think.
This, now that's the McNugget maker,
and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.
And let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,
and then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you --
she's about 300 pounds now.
No, she's not, she's beautiful.
This is how they looked when they came out at the end.
These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line.
And it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.
 
Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.
That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.
This is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.
This is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll."
That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.
That paid the rent for about a month.
This is a walking Barbie -- I said, "Oh, this is it!"
And they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.
So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.
They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?
And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.
They're pretty cool.
This is a-- we're doing some flight-testing
on my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.
It does pretty good.
I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.
It's how they, see, have those album things -- kids don't know what they are.
This is a clay maker.
You know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh,
and said, "Look, I can animate this."
They said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh."
And then, I made a Lego animator.
I thought, this would be so great!
And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.
That's the answer. They know everything about it.
 
Then I started doing animatronics.
I loved dinosaurs.
I used to be in the film business, kind of,
and actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,
and anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight."
You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur?
This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.
That's David Letterman.
You can see how old this stuff is.
That's my youngest cousin.
This is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas."
We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.
My career basically peaked here.
And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.
This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.
So this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor.
And I'm really not very good at it.
But the -- this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,
who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.
And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.
And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.
And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.
This is a -- you can see the little window there.
You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.
You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.
Way ahead of my time here.
 
(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...
Narrator: I love toys!
 
Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.
OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a --
that was the first batch of products.
Most of them did not go.
You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.
And every now and then, we do something like a,
you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,
that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and --
and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.
But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,
where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.
And I started working on this project
-- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.
Throughout this whole thing, making toys,
I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.
There's some kind of a blend that happens
that allows, you know, to find innovation.
And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol
that means something, to me anyway.
And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,
that's where I think innovation happens.
And actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.
But it's not how you actually get leverage.
Actually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.
And those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.
But moving on.
So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.
As he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.
I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see.
So by way of showing you this, you can kind of
get an understanding of what it is to,
hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology
that has an emotional connection with the user.
So this is my family.
This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,
and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.
All right, there's that robot again.
I came out of the movie business, as I said,
and I said, let's make these animatronic robots.
Let's make these things.
And so I've always had a big interest in this.
This one actually didn't go anywhere,
but I got my feet wet doing this.
This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.
A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,
lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.
There's another one.
He actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.
Oh, this is a little pony, little pony -- very cute little thing.
 
The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.
So the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,
working on the Microsoft Barney.
And this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.
And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.
And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse
full of this stuff and see if they sell.
So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.
But anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,
decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.
What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?
And that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.
And so, I have all these design books,
like I'm sure many of you have.
And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby --
I have kind of the art and science.
I have the why over here, and the how over there.
I try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.
Because they're not just "bing" ideas;
you have to really dig deep in these things.
So there's some real pseudo-code over here,
and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.
And originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.
And then we said, well, you're going to feed him,
and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.
And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor
to make the eyes move, and the ears move,
and the body to move, and the mouth to move.
And, you know, I want to make it blink
and do all that at the same time.
Well, I came up with this kind of linear
expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.
Then I started to get a little more realistic
and I have to start drawing the stuff.
And there's my "note to self" at the top:
"lots of engineering."
So that turned out to be a little more than true.
There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces
and the little worm drive and all that stuff.
And then I've got to start building it,
so this is the real thing.
I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.
And that's my little workshop.
And there's the first little cam that drove Furby.
And there's Furby on the half shell.
You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.
So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.
And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.
No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.
()
So right now, you see, I love little robots.
So my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will."
So she comes to the rescue.
This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,
my muse and my partner for eternity here.
And she does drawings, right?
She's an actual, you know, artist.
And she starts doing all these different drawings
and does color patterns and coloring books.
And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.
He didn't test so well, but I like him.
And then she started doing these other images.
At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,
and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.
So here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.
And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.
There's my favorite, Demon Furby.
That was a good one.
Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,
little poufy body, a little imaginary character.
And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.
I actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,
ripped it apart and made this.
And since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Us
with dolls or something, they disappear from my desk
and they get hidden in the house.
I have three girls and they just, they --
it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.
()
So, a little tether coming off,
it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.
It's just a little server control and I made a little video going:
"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,"
you know, and then I'd reach my hand.
He'd -- you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,
"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.
And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,
said, "Yeah, we want to do this.
We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,
and we're going to hire you guys to do this."
 
And so Dave and I got working.
Mostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.
So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff
I don't know how to do.
And I started working with Solid Works
and a whole other group to do that.
And we started --
this was way back before there was really much SLA going on,
not a lot of rapid prototyping.
We certainly didn't have the money to do this.
They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,
so I had to call a friend of a friend
who was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.
And they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them."
So they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.
And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.
We snuck in on the weekend.
And so we just had a disc of the files.
But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.
So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.
And on the weekend we ran the parts for that.
So this is how they come out close to the end.
And then they looked like little Garfields there.
Eight months later -- you may remember this,
this was a -- total, total, total chaos.
For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.
They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.
I -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be.
And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.
And I just a little bit on each one.
 
So full circle -- why do I do this?
Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff?
And it's, of course, for your kids.
And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.
And she still actually has those.
So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise
up in Boise, on a river, you know. So
and then I started another company called Toy Innovation
and we did some projects with Mattel with
actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,
and we did Miracle Moves Baby,
made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.
And then I started another company.
We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,
won "Best Innovations" at CES,
but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,
I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,
and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,
and then people started to want to do it.
And they said they'd spend all this time.
So I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project."
The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur
as much as we can with today's technology.
And it's not really -- but as close as we can do.
And we're going to try to really pull this off,
intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.
Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.
So I picked a Camarasaurus,
because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.
And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.
That's a juvenile.
And so we actually went in.
There's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,"
where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.
And the picture from the book, so when I --
I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.
Very, very obsessive.
There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,
but the geometry's correct.
And then I went in, and measured all the geometry
because I figured, hey, biomimicry.
If I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.
So there's the motor.
And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.
Here's an example of what we did with the skull.
There's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.
There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.
There's the mechanism that would go in there,
kind of a Geneva drive.
There's some Solid Works versions of it.
Here's some SLA parts of the same thing.
And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.
There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.
There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.
And there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.
There's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,
it has kind of a cuteness already.
And the thing about blending science and art
in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,
and then you go back and do the shape,
and then you go back and forth.
The servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.
They had to fit within the envelope.
There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.
All the neck and the tail are cable,
so it moves smoothly and organically.
And then, of course, you're not done yet.
You have to get the look for the skin.
The skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.
So you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel
of the character.
Now, this is not -- we're character designers, right?
And we're still trying to keep with the real character.
So, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.
Now you start doing the sculpture for this.
And you can see we got a guy from --
who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs
to do the sculpting for us,
down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.
And then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,
and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.
And then, four years and 10 million dollars later,
we have a little Pleo.
John, do you want to bring him up?
 
John Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man
that's done most of the work with our 40-person company.
I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.
()
So, thank you, John, thank you,
and get back to work, all right, man?
All right --
()
-- no, it's very painful, so --
()
-- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.
This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.
So when you first get them, they're babies.
And you -- more you have them, kind of the older they get,
and they kind of learn through their behavior.
So this one, this one's actually asleep, and -- hang on.
Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.
So this guy's listening to my voice here.
But they have 40 sensors all over their body.
They have seven processors, they have 14 motors,
they have --
but you don't care, do you?
They're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.
So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?
There's something big and loud over here.
Hey.
()
That's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.
Yeah, they're like kids, you know.
You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.
I'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.
Here, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.
()
There you go.
That's what the investors think, that it's just --
()
-- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.
And we're hoping that -- you know,
our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things
in order to be more human.
And we think we can help that out by having
little creatures that you can love.
Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.
They do change over time.
But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.
And we have a -- I have a little something here.
Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.
We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.
We did include some things that are hopefully useful.
Excuse me, Pleo.
They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card,
so it's completely open architecture.
So anyone can plug him -- () -- thank you.
This is John over here.
Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.
You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a --
() --
you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.
Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.
We -- actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.
We have one animator who's taken it and
he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,
and they're going, "Whassup," you know?
()
You -- so it's -- yes, he likes that.
So they're a handful. We hope you get one.
I don't know what I'm missing to say,
but as a last thing, I'd like to say is that
if we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.
And there's a lot of social responsibility in that.
That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.
And so I just -- I hope we all dream well.
Thank you.

So, I'm in Chile,
in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,
because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,
and I have this picture up on my screen,
and a woman comes up behind me.
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."
 
()
 
And, you know, "Excuse me!"
And I could sense
that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.
 
()
 
So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."
 
()
 
Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands
taking pictures of penguins.
This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.
So, literally, a few minutes before that,
I downloaded this scientific paper
about calculations on avian defecation,
which is really quite interesting, because it turns out
you can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"
and you can learn an awful lot
about the physics of the avian rectum.
Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.
 
At this point, she stops me,
and she says, "Who are you?
Wha -- what do you do?"
And I was stuck,
because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.
And so, in some sense,
this talk today
is my answer to that.
It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.
And it's very hard for me to make sense of it,
so I'm not sure that you can.
It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --
often at four in the morning.
 
So, some people are afraid of what I do.
Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,
and in response, I have ordered
a bulletproof pocket protector.
I'm not sure what these people think,
because I don't speak Norsk.
 
()
 
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.
I don't know, you know?
So, one of the things that I love to do
is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity
to study past civilizations,
and see where they succeeded
and where they failed.
Use science to, you know,
work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"
 
And recently, I was in Easter Island,
which is an incredibly beautiful place,
and an incredibly mysterious place,
because no matter where you go in Easter Island,
you're struck by these statues, called the moai.
The place is 64 square miles.
They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.
Why on Earth? And if you haven't read
Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"
I totally recommend that you do.
He's got a great chapter about it.
Basically, these people
committed ecological suicide
in order to make more of these.
And somewhere along the line, somebody said,
"I know! Let's cut down the last tree
and commit suicide, because
we need more identical statues."
 
()
 
And,
one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,
was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --
and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.
Where did they get that inspiration?
And then I met Yoyo,
who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,
and if you look at Yoyo's face,
you kind of figure out where they got it.
 
There's many mysteries, these statues.
Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,
how did they transport them?
This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.
She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.
And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,
and she has detailed records of every single statue.
The one on the page here is the same that's up there.
One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.
So, this used to be completely smooth.
In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,
the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.
But after 1,000 years out in the weather,
they look like this.
 
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,
and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,
first because it's a way of preserving them.
Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,
learn a few of the mysteries about them.
How long have they been standing in what positions?
And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of
what caused them to be the way they are.
While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,
so you get a gratuitous picture
of a moai with a comet.
 
I also have an archaeological project going on
in Egypt.
"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.
We're trying to get all of the permissions
to get everything all set, to get it going.
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.
But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.
Another thing I do is I invent stuff.
In fact, I design nuclear reactors.
Not a joke.
This is the conventional
nuclear fuel cycle.
The red line is what is done in
most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.
The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,
where you reprocess.
 
Now, this is the normal way it's done.
It's got the huge advantage that it
does not create carbon pollution.
It has a lot of disadvantages:
each one of these steps is extremely expensive,
it's potentially dangerous
and they have the interesting property that the step
cannot be performed in anyone's backyard,
which is a problem.
So, our reactor eliminates these steps,
which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.
Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.
There's -- no reactor's been even built
to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States
for 25 years.
It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return
thing that we do.
 
Changing into a totally different field,
we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,
particularly in an area called metamaterials.
A metamaterial is an artificial material,
which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,
in a way that you couldn't otherwise.
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,
this is how you would view it.
Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --
come in, and they just squish around the cell,
and they come back the other side.
Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.
Metamaterials, unfortunately --
A, it only works on microwave,
and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.
But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say
it's a zero billion dollar business, but,
in fact, it's negative.
But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.
 
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.
In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation
to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing
diseases in developing countries.
So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --
turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.
And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.
 
Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.
While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence
and went to a chef school in France.
I used to work, also while at Microsoft,
at a leading restaurant in Seattle,
so I do a lot of cooking.
I've been on a team that won
the world championship of barbecue.
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods
like chili, or bouillabaisse.
Various parts of the world will have a cult food
that people get enormously attached to --
there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.
And I'm trying to use a very
scientific approach.
So, this is my latest cooker,
and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,
that's because it is.
But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --
and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --
you can make some terrific ribs.
 
()
 
This is a high-speed centrifuge.
You should all have one in your kitchen,
beside your Turbochef.
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times
that of normal gravity,
and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.
You would not believe it!
I perform a series of ghoulish experiments
on food --
in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model
so that one can predict exactly
what the internal cooking times are.
It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.
Theory is red,
black is experiment.
So, I'm either really good at faking it,
or this particular model seems to work.
 
So, another random thing I do
is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
or SETI.
And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"
which sort of popularized that.
It turns out there are real people who go out
and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.
In fact, almost everybody in the movie
is based on a real character, a real person.
So, the Jodie Foster character here
is actually this woman, Jill Tarter,
and Jill has dedicated her life to this.
You know, a lot of people risk their lives
in a brief act of heroism,
which is kind of cool,
but Jill has
what I call slow heroism.
She is risking her professional life on something
that her own calculations show
may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.
So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.
 
After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.
My kids saw the movie,
and afterwards they came to me and they said,
"So, Dad, so -- so --
that character -- that's Jill, right?"
I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely."
"And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes."
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?
Is that you?"
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."
 
()
 
So, the SETI Institute,
with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen
and a variety of other people,
is building a dedicated radio telescope
in Hat Creek, California,
so they can do this SETI work.
Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,
and the one person who always gets updated
on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else
is Jill, because I really don't want to miss
"the call."
 
()
 
I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,
and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.
I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.
And I resemble that remark.
I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,
which is the finding of them.
Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions
looking for a dinosaur.
It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.
It's horrible conditions, because
wherever you have nice weather,
plants grow,
and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.
So, you always find dinosaurs
in deserts or badlands,
areas that have very little plant growth
and have flash floods in the spring.
You know, skiers pray for snow?
Paleontologists pray for erosion.
 
So, you hike around
and -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.
You hike around, you see something like this.
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.
You've got this bentonite clay,
which is -- sort of swells up and expands.
And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,
and you look up close, and you say,
"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,
from the shape, that these are skull fragments.
And then when you look at this,
you say, "That's a tooth.
It's a big tooth."
It's about the size of a banana.
It has a big serration on the edge.
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.
And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,
which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.
 
Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.
Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,
and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,
and I don't have room for two.
You know.
So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs
is that it is both an intellectual thing,
because you're trying to reconstruct the environment
of millions of years ago.
It's something that can inform all sorts of science
in unexpected ways.
The study of dinosaurs led to the realization
that there's a problem with asteroid impact,
for example.
The study of dinosaurs may, literally,
one day save the planet.
 
Study of the ancient climate is very important.
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,
had much higher CO2 than today,
was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points
for the effects of CO2 on climate.
But, besides being intellectually
and scientifically interesting, it's also very different
than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.
This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."
It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,
so we're not going to go into it further.
 
Now, I'm also really big on photography.
I travel all over the world taking pictures --
some of them good, most of them not.
These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means
you've got to spend more time sorting through them.
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands
of king penguins on a beach.
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.
I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,
and we had looked for a week,
and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.
And the last day, the sun comes out,
the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.
And I get lots of pictures like this.
Then, a little bit later,
I start getting some pictures like this.
Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that
if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,
this would be the centerfold.
It's true.
So, there's more and more activity near the boat,
and all of a sudden somebody shouts,
"What's that in the water?"
I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."
 
()
 
There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.
 
()
The first thing you learn
is the overwhelming importance of hands.
They don't have them.
 
()
 
I think Paul Simon is in the audience,
and he has --
he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,
"Slip-Slidin' Away."
That's kind of what it's like.
The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:
they curl their toes too.
 
()
 
So --
where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?
You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom
in finding a great thing, passion in life,
and focusing all your energy on it,
and I've never been able to do that.
I just -- you know, because, yes,
I'll focus passion on something,
but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought,
"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."
And you know, when I was at Microsoft,
that was so engrossing,
and the whole industry was expanding so much,
that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.
 
But ultimately,
I decided
that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,
but embrace it.
And say, "Yeah, you know, I --
this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,
but that's really what works for me."
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors
or metamaterials or whale sex,
the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.
That's it, thank you.
