off the screen into	0.00015330745588040153
you a clip of	0.00015330745588040153
eventually we get to	0.00015330745588040153
and lots of robots	0.00015330745588040153
the virtual world so	0.00015330745588040153
this kind of black	0.00015330745588040153
would mature a bit	0.00015330745588040153
life also has a	0.00015330745588040153

the quality of advice	0.00015330745588040153
on the fly so	0.00015330745588040153
present on the early	0.00015330745588040153
possible life there could	0.00015330745588040153
want them to play	0.00015330745588040153
youre not doing anything	0.00015330745588040153
talking about the future	0.00015330745588040153
because they sense the	0.00015330745588040153
going to add some	0.00015330745588040153
what is conspicuously lacking	0.00015330745588040153
environment into building blocks	0.00015330745588040153
into building blocks so	0.00015330745588040153
the smaller you make	0.00015330745588040153

do that your brain	0.00015330745588040153
blocks so it can	0.00015330745588040153
the characteristics of living	0.00015330745588040153
you increase the speed	0.00015330745588040153

build a robot that	0.00015330745588040153
brain is talking to	0.00015330745588040153
the robots have to	0.00015330745588040153
they love the screen	0.00015330745588040153
make and break chemical	0.00015330745588040153

last 20 years of	0.00015330745588040153
with a remote collaborator	0.00015330745588040153
start to imagine new	0.00015330745588040153
that robots are actually	0.00015330745588040153
living and living systems	0.00015330745588040153
by designing the human	0.00015330745588040153
to be affected by	0.00015330745588040153
to have a bit	0.00015330745588040153
focus on that and	0.00015330745588040153
going to leave it	0.00015330745588040153
cookie monster is very	0.00015330745588040153
resources from the environment	0.00015330745588040153
it so in this	0.00015330745588040153
ive been here before	0.00015330745588040153
the environment into building	0.00015330745588040153
very different from life	0.00015330745588040153
building blocks so it	0.00015330745588040153
the right type of	0.00015330745588040153
increase the speed of	0.00015330745588040153
of it is just	0.00015330745588040153
pops into your head	0.00015330745588040153
human into the process	0.00015330745588040153
these small robots is	0.00015330745588040153
of these characteristics of	0.00015330745588040153
my brain is talking	0.00015330745588040153
the screen into the	0.00015330745588040153
and break chemical bonds	0.00015330745588040153
want to show you	0.000152292979520191
to show you something	0.00014847038175614318
to play a game	0.00014847038175614318
we actually have a	0.00014847038175614318
to talk about is	0.0001469690273864686
what youre doing is	0.0001437652162222819
we can come up	0.0001437652162222819
the speed of the	0.0001437652162222819
here is some text	0.00014203354297938141
in it too i	0.00014203354297938141
can inspire us to	0.00014203354297938141
lost it this week	0.00014203354297938141
lot in common with	0.00014203354297938141
out in excruciating detail	0.00014203354297938141
the left sides and	0.00014203354297938141
just learned how to	0.00014203354297938141
that my girlfriend gave	0.00014203354297938141
is doubling every year	0.00014203354297938141
that computers can see	0.00014203354297938141
little blue light in	0.00014203354297938141
were not able to	0.00014203354297938141
work and it was	0.00014203354297938141
over the next 50	0.00014203354297938141
all this together and	0.00014203354297938141
into the body to	0.00014203354297938141
inspire us to be	0.00014203354297938141
and the right sides	0.00014203354297938141
theyre helping us to	0.00014203354297938141
sides and the right	0.00014203354297938141
the kind of robot	0.00014203354297938141
it too i almost	0.00014203354297938141
have just learned how	0.00014203354297938141
too i almost lost	0.00014203354297938141
we called it the	0.00014203354297938141
blue light in it	0.00014203354297938141
watch that my girlfriend	0.00014203354297938141
computers can learn to	0.00014203354297938141
could be out there	0.00014203354297938141
seeing a lot of	0.00014203354297938141
so in this video	0.00014203354297938141
left sides and the	0.00014203354297938141
and heres the robot	0.00014203354297938141
almost lost it this	0.00014203354297938141
are all mixed up	0.00014203354297938141
where do we get	0.00014203354297938141
is some text that	0.00014203354297938141
a watch that my	0.00014203354297938141
is a watch that	0.00014203354297938141
and catch the fall	0.00014203354297938141
light in it too	0.00014203354297938141
i almost lost it	0.00014203354297938141
my girlfriend gave me	0.00014203354297938141
deep learning algorithm to	0.00014203354297938141
me an important lesson	0.00014203354297938141
of the human heres	0.00014203354297938141
got a little blue	0.00014203354297938141
profound question he said	0.00014203354297938141
with deep learning using	0.00014203354297938141
to be better humans	0.00014203354297938141
everyone else had assumed	0.00014203354297938141
the machine learning revolution	0.00014203354297938141
a robot that has	0.00014203354297938141
what its looking at	0.00014203354297938141
if you increase the	0.00014203354297938141
looks like when the	0.00014203354297938141
now that computers can	0.00014203354297938141
a little blue light	0.00014203354297938141
taught me an important	0.00014203354297938141
what were going to	0.00014013047384586793
the first hour of	0.00013940891336226103
as much as possible	0.00013940891336226103
we didnt have to	0.00013940891336226103
i want to show	0.00013581800344076523
what do i think	0.00013535329242641596
ill tell you about	0.00013535329242641596
you want to go	0.0001344017578596592
what were doing is	0.0001344017578596592
use their body to	0.00013328881675956326
this is a watch	0.00013328881675956326
of a human than	0.00013328881675956326
but i think for	0.00013328881675956326
use our bodies to	0.00013328881675956326
according to the logic	0.00013328881675956326
out its really hard	0.00013328881675956326
more of a computer	0.00013328881675956326
human is not a	0.00013328881675956326
is an essentially philosophical	0.00013328881675956326
that write like computers	0.00013328881675956326
can we build a	0.00013328881675956326
the things we really	0.00013328881675956326
can we build it	0.00013328881675956326
that reflects any idea	0.00013328881675956326
to the logic of	0.00013328881675956326
more like a chess	0.00013328881675956326
have computers that write	0.00013328881675956326
think poem 1 was	0.00013328881675956326
gertrude stein is a	0.00013328881675956326
back to us we	0.00013328881675956326
we have a good	0.00013328881675956326
that the human is	0.00013328881675956326
that william blake is	0.00013328881675956326
we have computers that	0.00013328881675956326
a human than gertrude	0.00013328881675956326
building a robot that	0.00013328881675956326
size of a table	0.00013328881675956326
i tried to build	0.00013328881675956326
to be less of	0.00013328881675956326
can now start to	0.00013328881675956326
you think poem 1	0.00013328881675956326
you think poem 2	0.00013328881675956326
to be living in	0.00013328881675956326
we can now start	0.00013328881675956326
thousand miles an hour	0.00013328881675956326
us to be better	0.00013328881675956326
can see the robot	0.00013328881675956326
all have a common	0.00013328881675956326
mirror that reflects any	0.00013328881675956326
use your body to	0.00013328881675956326
a socially expressive head	0.00013328881675956326
a turing test for	0.00013328881675956326
humans that write like	0.00013328881675956326
more of a human	0.00013328881675956326
generated by an algorithm	0.00013328881675956326
a mirror that reflects	0.00013328881675956326
what a robotic musician	0.00013328881675956326
2 was written by	0.00013328881675956326
was generated by an	0.00013328881675956326
by an algorithm called	0.00013328881675956326
i was at college	0.00013328881675956326
with the calculated brain	0.00013328881675956326
that changes over time	0.00013328881675956326
turns out its really	0.00013328881675956326
one was written by	0.00013328881675956326
and do things that	0.00013328881675956326
the human is not	0.00013328881675956326
us we show it	0.00013328881675956326
if you have lots	0.00013328881675956326
cant be answered with	0.00013328881675956326
