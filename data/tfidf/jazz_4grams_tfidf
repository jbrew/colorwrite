a mistake the only	0.0025441154070049536
i want the music	0.0025441154070049536
the music to go	0.0025441154070049536
perceive that as a	0.0025441154070049536
if you played an	0.0025441154070049536
that as a mistake	0.0025441154070049536
were going to play	0.002153098285047059
a few more extracts	0.001986302617632976
to regain a certain	0.001986302617632976
first ones in brazil	0.001986302617632976
why do we record	0.001986302617632976
far from the cliches	0.001986302617632976
music in a different	0.001986302617632976
only with the help	0.001986302617632976
about what i would	0.001986302617632976
idea about what i	0.001986302617632976
this is important to	0.001986302617632976
regain a certain complexity	0.001986302617632976
no idea about what	0.0018402340355300154
a socially expressive head	0.0017269344410572002
the way it moves	0.0017269344410572002
body to find the	0.0017269344410572002
lot of bobbing heads	0.0017269344410572002
more like a chess	0.0017269344410572002
other works in human	0.0017269344410572002
with the calculated brain	0.0017269344410572002
what a robotic musician	0.0017269344410572002
to be less of	0.0017269344410572002
use their body to	0.0017269344410572002
use your body to	0.0017269344410572002
people with the calculated	0.0017269344410572002
in the north of	0.0017269344410572002
one place to another	0.0017269344410572002
a robotic musician would	0.0017269344410572002
use our bodies to	0.0017269344410572002
a lot of bobbing	0.0017269344410572002
the memory of the	0.001634361931895507
lets call it the	0.001634361931895507
maybe they should be	0.0015560929906275414
had no idea about	0.0015560929906275414
they should be able	0.0014882933497925464
have to use your	0.0014882933497925464
so i tried to	0.0014882933497925464
to get closer to	0.0014882933497925464
from one place to	0.0014882933497925464
want to know something	0.0014882933497925464
for a second and	0.0013749937553197312
went back to my	0.0013749937553197312
and at some point	0.0013646302126641698
be less of a	0.0013266006708798606
all accept his ideas	0.0012720577035024768
what a funny note	0.0012720577035024768
react to it hell	0.0012720577035024768
no idea what key	0.0012720577035024768
mistake the only way	0.0012720577035024768
music to get to	0.0012720577035024768
will change well all	0.0012720577035024768
palette and at some	0.0012720577035024768
actually limits the artistic	0.0012720577035024768
on the bandstand and	0.0012720577035024768
here in the moment	0.0012720577035024768
didnt react to it	0.0012720577035024768
right inside of the	0.0012720577035024768
his fellow band member	0.0012720577035024768
and gradually it builds	0.0012720577035024768
you played an e	0.0012720577035024768
someone could conceptually perceive	0.0012720577035024768
to the band that	0.0012720577035024768
engage and inspire the	0.0012720577035024768
maybe not everyones listening	0.0012720577035024768
accepting one another and	0.0012720577035024768
more nuanced its not	0.0012720577035024768
playing on a palette	0.0012720577035024768
all relate to behavioral	0.0012720577035024768
that does is it	0.0012720577035024768
you walk on the	0.0012720577035024768
but what that does	0.0012720577035024768
didnt realize there was	0.0012720577035024768
it is that someone	0.0012720577035024768
that sounded like this	0.0012720577035024768
general emotional palette that	0.0012720577035024768
opportunity to think about	0.0012720577035024768
is a blessing so	0.0012720577035024768
only mistake is if	0.0012720577035024768
just play some time	0.0012720577035024768
really a sacred space	0.0012720577035024768
mr jamire williams on	0.0012720577035024768
were responding you have	0.0012720577035024768
idea what key we	0.0012720577035024768
like play an f	0.0012720577035024768
play with this palette	0.0012720577035024768
lie right inside of	0.0012720577035024768
artistic possibilities if i	0.0012720577035024768
you really are alive	0.0012720577035024768
very purifying experience and	0.0012720577035024768
going to play on	0.0012720577035024768
i can do so	0.0012720577035024768
of made our way	0.0012720577035024768
i really want the	0.0012720577035024768
are so many decisions	0.0012720577035024768
way that i would	0.0012720577035024768
have a great relationship	0.0012720577035024768
palette if you played	0.0012720577035024768
it hell introduce it	0.0012720577035024768
far more to do	0.0012720577035024768
an opportunity in jazz	0.0012720577035024768
realize there was going	0.0012720577035024768
being made when you	0.0012720577035024768
to perceive what it	0.0012720577035024768
not aware and accepting	0.0012720577035024768
even describe what a	0.0012720577035024768
and allowing creativity to	0.0012720577035024768
on this palette and	0.0012720577035024768
out the way that	0.0012720577035024768
people who do but	0.0012720577035024768
to play just for	0.0012720577035024768
music to go this	0.0012720577035024768
little bit more intense	0.0012720577035024768
well react to it	0.0012720577035024768
just wanted to sort	0.0012720577035024768
the first step for	0.0012720577035024768
get to a certain	0.0012720577035024768
responded to it so	0.0012720577035024768
want to play like	0.0012720577035024768
that i would say	0.0012720577035024768
around me when you	0.0012720577035024768
palette again hell play	0.0012720577035024768
in jazz you have	0.0012720577035024768
texture changed in the	0.0012720577035024768
ill talk for a	0.0012720577035024768
play it i dont	0.0012720577035024768
note i ended up	0.0012720577035024768
an opportunity that was	0.0012720577035024768
on around me when	0.0012720577035024768
made our way into	0.0012720577035024768
how well react to	0.0012720577035024768
key we were going	0.0012720577035024768
music to go there	0.0012720577035024768
im bullying my ideas	0.0012720577035024768
up creating a melody	0.0012720577035024768
it actually limits the	0.0012720577035024768
with what i just	0.0012720577035024768
so its unpredictable well	0.0012720577035024768
unpredictable well paint this	0.0012720577035024768
dynamic of it is	0.0012720577035024768
band that i want	0.0012720577035024768
for granted we know	0.0012720577035024768
the music to get	0.0012720577035024768
is not aware and	0.0012720577035024768
not about bullying my	0.0012720577035024768
amazing its a very	0.0012720577035024768
drums this time it	0.0012720577035024768
that someone else did	0.0012720577035024768
purifying experience and i	0.0012720577035024768
a very purifying experience	0.0012720577035024768
from something thats going	0.0012720577035024768
response to how i	0.0012720577035024768
we didnt react to	0.0012720577035024768
going to play just	0.0012720577035024768
accepting enough of his	0.0012720577035024768
there is no mistake	0.0012720577035024768
if each individual musician	0.0012720577035024768
ended up creating a	0.0012720577035024768
than what it is	0.0012720577035024768
something thats going on	0.0012720577035024768
know that i speak	0.0012720577035024768
listen to whats going	0.0012720577035024768
listening were responding you	0.0012720577035024768
a mistake is in	0.0012720577035024768
and we dont allow	0.0012720577035024768
enough of his fellow	0.0012720577035024768
relate to behavioral finance	0.0012720577035024768
some people who do	0.0012720577035024768
little bit more rhythmic	0.0012720577035024768
you engage and inspire	0.0012720577035024768
past you really are	0.0012720577035024768
palette that we were	0.0012720577035024768
is absolutely amazing its	0.0012720577035024768
its unpredictable well paint	0.0012720577035024768
like we were playing	0.0012720577035024768
bullying my vision or	0.0012720577035024768
we dont micromanage in	0.0012720577035024768
experience and i know	0.0012720577035024768
each individual musician is	0.0012720577035024768
to start with what	0.0012720577035024768
is a science of	0.0012720577035024768
christian played a note	0.0012720577035024768
could conceptually perceive that	0.0012720577035024768
music before so i	0.0012720577035024768
the bandstand we had	0.0012720577035024768
hell introduce it for	0.0012720577035024768
to talk about someone	0.0012720577035024768
gradually it builds watch	0.0012720577035024768
the past you really	0.0012720577035024768
our way into a	0.0012720577035024768
inside of the color	0.0012720577035024768
welcome mr jamire williams	0.0012720577035024768
played this note i	0.0012720577035024768
this general emotional palette	0.0012720577035024768
until it happens i	0.0012720577035024768
to listen this is	0.0012720577035024768
in the drums this	0.0012720577035024768
vision or anything like	0.0012720577035024768
this all relate to	0.0012720577035024768
have no time for	0.0012720577035024768
much more nuanced its	0.0012720577035024768
a funny note would	0.0012720577035024768
no time for projected	0.0012720577035024768
bullying my ideas im	0.0012720577035024768
what it is until	0.0012720577035024768
be a little music	0.0012720577035024768
i just jump right	0.0012720577035024768
but something will change	0.0012720577035024768
wont react to it	0.0012720577035024768
do but what that	0.0012720577035024768
incorporate the idea and	0.0012720577035024768
and i just jump	0.0012720577035024768
that we dont micromanage	0.0012720577035024768
time for projected ideas	0.0012720577035024768
listening it has far	0.0012720577035024768
happens when we play	0.0012720577035024768
these all lie right	0.0012720577035024768
into a song called	0.0012720577035024768
ideas im telling them	0.0012720577035024768
who do but what	0.0012720577035024768
time it got a	0.0012720577035024768
missed so its unpredictable	0.0012720577035024768
more organic its much	0.0012720577035024768
and inspire the other	0.0012720577035024768
is an opportunity in	0.0012720577035024768
change well all accept	0.0012720577035024768
come with me over	0.0012720577035024768
we wont react to	0.0012720577035024768
this palette and at	0.0012720577035024768
of this general emotional	0.0012720577035024768
before so i think	0.0012720577035024768
all right inside of	0.0012720577035024768
possibilities if i come	0.0012720577035024768
listen this is a	0.0012720577035024768
conceptually perceive that as	0.0012720577035024768
its much more nuanced	0.0012720577035024768
travis on the bass	0.0012720577035024768
really are alive right	0.0012720577035024768
this bandstand is absolutely	0.0012720577035024768
able to come on	0.0012720577035024768
i dictate to the	0.0012720577035024768
really see it as	0.0012720577035024768
im on the bandstand	0.0012720577035024768
introduce this note and	0.0012720577035024768
way i perceive a	0.0012720577035024768
im pulling ideas its	0.0012720577035024768
that to be able	0.0012720577035024768
and mr christian sands	0.0012720577035024768
going to play i	0.0012720577035024768
when im pulling ideas	0.0012720577035024768
so many decisions being	0.0012720577035024768
made when you walk	0.0012720577035024768
what i can perceive	0.0012720577035024768
lies in that im	0.0012720577035024768
williams on the drums	0.0012720577035024768
it is until it	0.0012720577035024768
in in the middle	0.0012720577035024768
micromanage in jazz you	0.0012720577035024768
it the texture changed	0.0012720577035024768
going on and pull	0.0012720577035024768
i can perceive than	0.0012720577035024768
mistake lies in that	0.0012720577035024768
way into a song	0.0012720577035024768
but that could have	0.0012720577035024768
what key we were	0.0012720577035024768
of a jazz musician	0.0012720577035024768
to play i wont	0.0012720577035024768
changed in the drums	0.0012720577035024768
something will change well	0.0012720577035024768
to it so there	0.0012720577035024768
played an e see	0.0012720577035024768
were playing on a	0.0012720577035024768
well paint this palette	0.0012720577035024768
bandstand we had no	0.0012720577035024768
you that we dont	0.0012720577035024768
is really a sacred	0.0012720577035024768
a second and were	0.0012720577035024768
with me over this	0.0012720577035024768
that i speak for	0.0012720577035024768
christian will introduce this	0.0012720577035024768
different experience when im	0.0012720577035024768
so if christian played	0.0012720577035024768
idea and we dont	0.0012720577035024768
sacred about it is	0.0012720577035024768
again hell play it	0.0012720577035024768
if im not aware	0.0012720577035024768
it and the other	0.0012720577035024768
come on the bandstand	0.0012720577035024768
to even describe what	0.0012720577035024768
kind of chaotic because	0.0012720577035024768
someone else did every	0.0012720577035024768
they give you more	0.0012720577035024768
for a second well	0.0012720577035024768
me is to be	0.0012720577035024768
musicians and they give	0.0012720577035024768
talk for a second	0.0012720577035024768
what i just heard	0.0012720577035024768
certain level of intensity	0.0012720577035024768
speak for all of	0.0012720577035024768
pull from something thats	0.0012720577035024768
only mistake lies in	0.0012720577035024768
its a very purifying	0.0012720577035024768
to how i responded	0.0012720577035024768
me when you do	0.0012720577035024768
play some time one	0.0012720577035024768
mistake is in that	0.0012720577035024768
is really sacred about	0.0012720577035024768
mistake when im on	0.0012720577035024768
bit more intense in	0.0012720577035024768
the drums this time	0.0012720577035024768
it as a mistake	0.0012720577035024768
in that im not	0.0012720577035024768
to listen to whats	0.0012720577035024768
a second well see	0.0012720577035024768
perceive what it is	0.0012720577035024768
easier to talk about	0.0012720577035024768
way that we handle	0.0012720577035024768
color palette if you	0.0012720577035024768
right inside of this	0.0012720577035024768
so someone could conceptually	0.0012720577035024768
the other dynamic of	0.0012720577035024768
everyones listening were responding	0.0012720577035024768
nuanced its not about	0.0012720577035024768
a little music before	0.0012720577035024768
a great relationship to	0.0012720577035024768
other musicians and they	0.0012720577035024768
pulling ideas its much	0.0012720577035024768
for me is to	0.0012720577035024768
that is really sacred	0.0012720577035024768
bandstand and play music	0.0012720577035024768
handle it and the	0.0012720577035024768
space it is really	0.0012720577035024768
that we were painting	0.0012720577035024768
another and allowing creativity	0.0012720577035024768
it builds watch one	0.0012720577035024768
to come on the	0.0012720577035024768
i didnt realize there	0.0012720577035024768
burniss travis on the	0.0012720577035024768
member to incorporate the	0.0012720577035024768
elses mistake so the	0.0012720577035024768
its easier to talk	0.0012720577035024768
perceive a mistake when	0.0012720577035024768
about bullying my vision	0.0012720577035024768
of his fellow band	0.0012720577035024768
happens i didnt realize	0.0012720577035024768
sacred space and one	0.0012720577035024768
is to listen this	0.0012720577035024768
and the other dynamic	0.0012720577035024768
someone elses mistake so	0.0012720577035024768
great relationship to finance	0.0012720577035024768
painting if you played	0.0012720577035024768
absolutely amazing its a	0.0012720577035024768
one another and allowing	0.0012720577035024768
dont micromanage in jazz	0.0012720577035024768
was missed so its	0.0012720577035024768
was a mistake is	0.0012720577035024768
and accepting enough of	0.0012720577035024768
alive right here in	0.0012720577035024768
perspective of a jazz	0.0012720577035024768
can perceive than what	0.0012720577035024768
music is a blessing	0.0012720577035024768
musician is not aware	0.0012720577035024768
come up and i	0.0012720577035024768
second well see what	0.0012720577035024768
i perceive a mistake	0.0012720577035024768
inside of this general	0.0012720577035024768
to a certain level	0.0012720577035024768
in jazz so its	0.0012720577035024768
its much more organic	0.0012720577035024768
its kind of chaotic	0.0012720577035024768
jazz so its hard	0.0012720577035024768
responding you have no	0.0012720577035024768
out of it the	0.0012720577035024768
a blessing so how	0.0012720577035024768
all lie right inside	0.0012720577035024768
individual musician is not	0.0012720577035024768
and then ill stop	0.0012720577035024768
that we handle it	0.0012720577035024768
you have no opportunity	0.0012720577035024768
to go this way	0.0012720577035024768
second and were going	0.0012720577035024768
opportunity in jazz so	0.0012720577035024768
that was missed so	0.0012720577035024768
jazz you have some	0.0012720577035024768
if christian played a	0.0012720577035024768
it is to listen	0.0012720577035024768
lets welcome mr jamire	0.0012720577035024768
the only mistake is	0.0012720577035024768
we handle it and	0.0012720577035024768
know how well react	0.0012720577035024768
of point out the	0.0012720577035024768
the idea and we	0.0012720577035024768
you have no time	0.0012720577035024768
of us when i	0.0012720577035024768
limits the artistic possibilities	0.0012720577035024768
hard to even describe	0.0012720577035024768
that we didnt react	0.0012720577035024768
is it actually limits	0.0012720577035024768
is to be patient	0.0012720577035024768
sort of point out	0.0012720577035024768
when im on the	0.0012720577035024768
opportunity that was missed	0.0012720577035024768
talk about someone elses	0.0012720577035024768
it happens i didnt	0.0012720577035024768
this palette again hell	0.0012720577035024768
intense in response to	0.0012720577035024768
play i wont be	0.0012720577035024768
bandstand is absolutely amazing	0.0012720577035024768
is that someone else	0.0012720577035024768
dictate to the band	0.0012720577035024768
step for me is	0.0012720577035024768
really want the music	0.0012720577035024768
you come with me	0.0012720577035024768
dont allow for creativity	0.0012720577035024768
perceive than what it	0.0012720577035024768
play in in the	0.0012720577035024768
note and we wont	0.0012720577035024768
is in that we	0.0012720577035024768
other dynamic of it	0.0012720577035024768
we were painting if	0.0012720577035024768
on and pull from	0.0012720577035024768
my vision or anything	0.0012720577035024768
us when i tell	0.0012720577035024768
just jump right in	0.0012720577035024768
the other musicians and	0.0012720577035024768
much more organic its	0.0012720577035024768
mistake is if im	0.0012720577035024768
i played a color	0.0012720577035024768
the artistic possibilities if	0.0012720577035024768
decisions being made when	0.0012720577035024768
fellow band member to	0.0012720577035024768
mr christian sands on	0.0012720577035024768
if i played a	0.0012720577035024768
moment there are so	0.0012720577035024768
i ended up creating	0.0012720577035024768
ideas its much more	0.0012720577035024768
many decisions being made	0.0012720577035024768
funny note would be	0.0012720577035024768
because im bullying my	0.0012720577035024768
this moment there are	0.0012720577035024768
the bandstand and play	0.0012720577035024768
sands on the piano	0.0012720577035024768
and pull from something	0.0012720577035024768
band member to incorporate	0.0012720577035024768
its about being here	0.0012720577035024768
we sort of made	0.0012720577035024768
to most peoples ears	0.0012720577035024768
jamire williams on the	0.0012720577035024768
able to perceive what	0.0012720577035024768
play music is a	0.0012720577035024768
to sort of point	0.0012720577035024768
were painting if you	0.0012720577035024768
so the way i	0.0012720577035024768
about someone elses mistake	0.0012720577035024768
they would perceive that	0.0012720577035024768
little music before so	0.0012720577035024768
this time it got	0.0012720577035024768
its not about bullying	0.0012720577035024768
totally different experience when	0.0012720577035024768
blessing so how does	0.0012720577035024768
granted we know that	0.0012720577035024768
up and i dictate	0.0012720577035024768
will introduce this note	0.0012720577035024768
of chaotic because im	0.0012720577035024768
aware and accepting enough	0.0012720577035024768
the color palette if	0.0012720577035024768
i speak for all	0.0012720577035024768
has far more to	0.0012720577035024768
things that is really	0.0012720577035024768
a mistake when im	0.0012720577035024768
it has far more	0.0012720577035024768
that im not able	0.0012720577035024768
experience when im pulling	0.0012720577035024768
and play music is	0.0012720577035024768
stereotypically we dont have	0.0012720577035024768
are alive right here	0.0012720577035024768
a melody out of	0.0012720577035024768
play like this and	0.0012720577035024768
you have some people	0.0012720577035024768
we dont allow for	0.0012720577035024768
of listening it has	0.0012720577035024768
like that its about	0.0012720577035024768
sort of made our	0.0012720577035024768
a science of listening	0.0012720577035024768
idea of a mistake	0.0012720577035024768
here in this moment	0.0012720577035024768
so stereotypically we dont	0.0012720577035024768
of it the texture	0.0012720577035024768
to play on this	0.0012720577035024768
