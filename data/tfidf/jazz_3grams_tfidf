an e see	0.001127252034667324
were jazz musicians	0.001127252034667324
really a sacred	0.001127252034667324
to listen this	0.001127252034667324
space it is	0.001127252034667324
different experience when	0.001127252034667324
palette that we	0.001127252034667324
past you really	0.001127252034667324
the bandstand and	0.001127252034667324
key we were	0.001127252034667324
we were painting	0.001127252034667324
an opportunity in	0.001127252034667324
from something thats	0.001127252034667324
christian sands on	0.001127252034667324
builds watch one	0.001127252034667324
the past you	0.001127252034667324
artistic possibilities if	0.001127252034667324
aware and accepting	0.001127252034667324
we dont micromanage	0.001127252034667324
not aware and	0.001127252034667324
band that i	0.001127252034667324
he played this	0.001127252034667324
chaotic because im	0.001127252034667324
this moment there	0.001127252034667324
inspire the other	0.001127252034667324
a jazz musician	0.001127252034667324
play on this	0.001127252034667324
i just jump	0.001127252034667324
on this palette	0.001127252034667324
easier to talk	0.001127252034667324
with me over	0.001127252034667324
i perceive a	0.001127252034667324
unpredictable well paint	0.001127252034667324
painting if you	0.001127252034667324
perceive a mistake	0.001127252034667324
drums this time	0.001127252034667324
micromanage in jazz	0.001127252034667324
limits the artistic	0.001127252034667324
an incredible space	0.001127252034667324
a melody out	0.001127252034667324
incorporate the idea	0.001127252034667324
second well see	0.001127252034667324
only mistake lies	0.001127252034667324
so if christian	0.001127252034667324

relationship to finance	0.001127252034667324
engage and inspire	0.001127252034667324
im not aware	0.001127252034667324
accepting one another	0.001127252034667324
first step for	0.001127252034667324
i speak for	0.001127252034667324
so someone could	0.001127252034667324
play in in	0.001127252034667324
lie right inside	0.001127252034667324
and allowing creativity	0.001127252034667324
allowing creativity to	0.001127252034667324
not about bullying	0.001127252034667324
sands on the	0.001127252034667324
only mistake is	0.001127252034667324
christian played a	0.001127252034667324
it builds watch	0.001127252034667324
it actually limits	0.001127252034667324
the band that	0.001127252034667324

when im pulling	0.001127252034667324
other musicians and	0.001127252034667324
to most peoples	0.001127252034667324
a second well	0.001127252034667324
we wont react	0.001127252034667324
how well react	0.001127252034667324
you engage and	0.001127252034667324
on the bass	0.001127252034667324
all right inside	0.001127252034667324
my ideas im	0.001127252034667324
hell play it	0.001127252034667324
really are alive	0.001127252034667324
this bandstand is	0.001127252034667324
but something will	0.001127252034667324
stereotypically we dont	0.001127252034667324
totally different experience	0.001127252034667324
speak for all	0.001127252034667324
little music before	0.001127252034667324
jazz so its	0.001127252034667324
sacred space and	0.001127252034667324
this palette and	0.001127252034667324
because im bullying	0.001127252034667324
ideas its much	0.001127252034667324
realize there was	0.001127252034667324
dictate to the	0.001127252034667324
so the bandstand	0.001127252034667324
who do but	0.001127252034667324
the texture changed	0.001127252034667324
bullying my vision	0.001127252034667324
of listening it	0.001127252034667324
of chaotic because	0.001127252034667324
well were jazz	0.001127252034667324
the color palette	0.001127252034667324
these all lie	0.001127252034667324
each individual musician	0.001127252034667324
ideas im telling	0.001127252034667324
someone else did	0.001127252034667324
sacred about it	0.001127252034667324
other dynamic of	0.001127252034667324
palette and at	0.001127252034667324
like play an	0.001127252034667324
to perceive what	0.001127252034667324
fellow band member	0.001127252034667324
dont allow for	0.001127252034667324
kind of chaotic	0.001127252034667324
emotional palette that	0.001127252034667324
even describe what	0.001127252034667324
this note and	0.001127252034667324
level of intensity	0.001127252034667324
the drums this	0.001127252034667324
a blessing so	0.001127252034667324
mr christian sands	0.001127252034667324
can perceive than	0.001127252034667324
general emotional palette	0.001127252034667324
opportunity to think	0.001127252034667324
just jump right	0.001127252034667324
jazz you have	0.001127252034667324
purifying experience and	0.001127252034667324
so many decisions	0.001127252034667324
relate to behavioral	0.001127252034667324
about someone elses	0.001127252034667324
incredible space it	0.001127252034667324
music to get	0.001127252034667324
is really sacred	0.001127252034667324
what key we	0.001127252034667324
not everyones listening	0.001127252034667324
we handle it	0.001127252034667324
on and pull	0.001127252034667324
maybe not everyones	0.001127252034667324
play some time	0.001127252034667324
happens i didnt	0.001127252034667324
science of listening	0.001127252034667324
bit more intense	0.001127252034667324
played this note	0.001127252034667324
me over this	0.001127252034667324
in jazz so	0.001127252034667324
it has far	0.001127252034667324
someone could conceptually	0.001127252034667324
and accepting enough	0.001127252034667324
bandstand is absolutely	0.001127252034667324
bandstand we had	0.001127252034667324
this general emotional	0.001127252034667324
i can perceive	0.001127252034667324
played an f	0.001127252034667324
played an e	0.001127252034667324
great relationship to	0.001127252034667324
to play like	0.001127252034667324
a very purifying	0.001127252034667324
a song called	0.001127252034667324
more intense in	0.001127252034667324
being made when	0.001127252034667324
well react to	0.001127252034667324
ill talk for	0.001127252034667324
and i dictate	0.001127252034667324
many decisions being	0.001127252034667324
in jazz you	0.001127252034667324
elses mistake so	0.001127252034667324
mistake is in	0.001127252034667324
and pull from	0.001127252034667324
mistake is if	0.001127252034667324
a funny note	0.001127252034667324
play an f	0.001127252034667324
were painting if	0.001127252034667324
are alive right	0.001127252034667324
so stereotypically we	0.001127252034667324
ended up creating	0.001127252034667324
listen to whats	0.001127252034667324
playing on a	0.001127252034667324
travis on the	0.001127252034667324
what a funny	0.001127252034667324
idea what key	0.001127252034667324
to behavioral finance	0.001127252034667324
bit more rhythmic	0.001127252034667324
then ill stop	0.001127252034667324
have no opportunity	0.001127252034667324
if christian played	0.001127252034667324
introduce this note	0.001127252034667324
accept his ideas	0.001127252034667324
going to play	0.0011243511166728398
its much more	0.0011036631362681614
what the robot	0.0011004211188457677
you show up	0.0011004211188457677
the memory of	0.0011004211188457677
know what its	0.0011004211188457677
this time with	0.0011004211188457677
much as possible	0.00106707669942902
a second and	0.0010069950829500447
with what i	0.0010069950829500447
of the team	0.0010069950829500447

of this general	0.0009713134113692486
much more nuanced	0.0009713134113692486
but that could	0.0009713134113692486
lies in that	0.0009713134113692486
know how well	0.0009713134113692486
if each individual	0.0009713134113692486
we dont allow	0.0009713134113692486
has far more	0.0009713134113692486
